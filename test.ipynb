       "{'article': [\"By . Anthony Bond . PUBLISHED: . 07:03 EST, 2 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:07 EST, 2 March 2013 . Three members of the same family who died in a static caravan from carbon monoxide poisoning would have been unconscious 'within minutes', investigators said today. The bodies of married couple John and Audrey Cook were discovered alongside their daughter, Maureen, at the mobile home they shared on Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, west Cornwall. The inquests have now opened into the deaths last Saturday, with investigators saying the three died along with the family's pet dog, of carbon monoxide poisoning from a cooker. Tragic: The inquests have opened into the deaths of three members of the same family who were found in their static caravan last weekend. John and Audrey Cook are pictured . Awful: The family died following carbon monoxide poisoning at this caravan at the Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, Cornwall . It is also believed there was no working carbon monoxide detector in the static caravan. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said this would have resulted in the three being unconscious 'within minutes', . A spokesman for Cornwall coroner Dr Emma Carlyon confirmed the inquests were opened and adjourned yesterday afternoon. They will resume at a later date. Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed on Monday that carbon monoxide poisoning had been established as the cause of death. A police spokesman said the source of the poisoning was 'believed to be from incorrect operation of the gas cooker'. Poisoning: This woman left flowers outside the caravan following the deaths. It has emerged that the trio would have been unconscious 'within minutes' Touching: This tribute was left outside the caravan following news of the deaths . Early readings from experts at the site revealed a potentially lethal level of carbon monoxide present within the caravan at the time it was taken, shortly after the discovery of the bodies.

       "  'UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- A rare meeting of U.N. Security Council heads of state, led for the first time by a U.S. president, adopted a resolution focused on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons Thursday. President Obama is the first U.S. leader to head a United Nations Security Council meeting. President Obama challenged the gathering -- which included leaders of nuclear powers including Russia, China, Great Britain and France -- to overcome cynicism against the goal of ridding the planet of nuclear arms. \"We harbor no illusions about the difficulty of bringing about a world without nuclear weapons,\" Obama said, adding that Thursday\\'s meeting signaled a significant step forward in cooperative global action. The resolution, which was adopted unanimously, calls for tighter controls on nuclear materials to prevent them from being used for military purposes or stolen. It also encourages enforcement of international treaties and U.N. resolutions regarding nuclear non-proliferation, particularly when nations such as Iran and North Korea are in violation. \"The world must stand together,\" Obama said. \"We must demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise.\" It was the first Security Council summit chaired by a U.S. president, and only the fifth time that Security Council heads of state have met. Obama led the meeting because the United States holds the revolving presidency of the Security Council in September. Both Obama and Russian President Dimitry Medvedev, who spoke later, said the world\\'s two nuclear superpowers were working on reducing their stockpiles in advance of a global nuclear summit scheduled for next year. \"It\\'s obvious that an effective solution ... depends on the constructive engagement of all parties,\" Medvedev said, adding that he expected the Russia-U.S. leadership on the issue to be backed by \"all nuclear powers.\" The measure passed Thursday -- Security Council resolution 1887 -- calls for \"locking down vulnerable nuclear weapons materials in four years\" while minimizing civilian use of weapons-grade uranium. It encourages full compliance with all international treaties and resolutions on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, including Security Council resolutions that cite North Korea and Iran for failing to adhere to international commitments. In addition, the resolution supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy, a theme backed by Chinese President Hu Jintao. China seeks to expand its nuclear energy capacity as part of an economic development plan that holds down greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown also cited the role of nuclear power as a clean energy source that should be part of the solution to global warming affecting every nation. Brown and other leaders spoke of the need to prevent nuclear weapons or the materials to make them from ending up in the hands of terrorist groups. \"The biggest risk the world faces today is of extremists getting hold of nuclear materials,\" said Mohammad ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who criticized the Security Council on Wednesday in a rambling speech to the U.N. General Assembly, was absent for the meeting. In Libya\\'s turn to speak at the summit, its special representative to the United Nations called for the IAEA to inspect all nuclear programs, including Israel\\'s, instead of focusing on non-nuclear states. Asked later about Gadhafi\\'s absence, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Libya could serve as an example to Iran and North Korea as a nation that gave up its nuclear weapons program and now had rejoined the full international community. \"I think the message that the Libyans had at the Security Council is a message that we hope that the Iranians and the North Koreans will take to heart, and that is giving up a nuclear weapons program and the benefits that it can have for international cooperation and for their reintegration into an international community,\" Gibbs said. Brown earlier called for sanctions against Iran for its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. On Wednesday, Medvedev signaled that Russia -- which previously has opposed such move -- also could support sanctions against Iran. \"Russia\\'s position is clear: sanctions rarely lead to productive results, but in some cases sanctions are inevitable,\" Medvedev said in a joint appearance with Obama after they met in New York. The statement bolsters U.S.-led efforts for increased international pressure on Iran to adhere to nonproliferation agreements in pursuing the development of nuclear energy. Iran claims its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes, but the international community accuses it of continuing to try to develop nuclear weapons capability. The Iranian mission to the United Nations released a statement after the Security Council meeting, saying the country\\'s nuclear activities \"are and always have been, for peaceful purposes, and, therefore, pose no threat whatsoever.\" \"In practicing its legitimate right to develop nuclear energy technology, Iran has always maintained its need for nuclear power as an alternative source of energy to supply its booming population and rapid development. ... Our commitment to nonproliferation remains intact,\" the statement added. The United States and Russia previously have disagreed over Iran, and over possible steps the Security Council may take -- including imposing sanctions -- to push Tehran to comply with U.N. demands concerning its nuclear program. Last week, Obama announced that the United States was dropping plans to base a missile defense shield system in Poland and the Czech Republic, a proposal that had rankled Moscow. He has denied the change was directly linked to Russia\\'s position regarding sanctions on Iran, but said any Russian shift in that direction would be a bonus.',\n",
       "  \"Cover-up: Former Archbishop Lord Hope allowed a paedophile priest to escape punishment for sex crimes, a judge's report claims . A former archbishop who failed to act on alleged crimes of a paedophile priest should be jailed, the abuser’s victims have said. Lord Hope, the former Archbishop of York, did not act on 19 occasions when allegations of abuse or inappropriate conduct by the priest were raised with him, a scathing report revealed yesterday. But despite that, Lord Hope remains as an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Bradford. Eli Ward and Bim Atkinson, who were among seven victims of the Very Reverend Robert Waddington, former Dean of Manchester, said it is ‘incredible’ that the man who did nothing to stop the priest has been allowed to keep his post. The report by Judge Sally Cahill QC said Lord Hope failed to act because his ‘concern for the welfare of Robert Waddington seems to have been paramount’. Waddington, who kept an official position in the church until 2005 and died in 2007, targeted young choirboys over several decades. One of the seven victims committed suicide in 1989. Mr Atkinson, 59, who was abused when Waddington was a priest in Australia in the 1960s, sent a picture of disgraced Tory peer Lord Archer, who was jailed for perjury, to the Bishop of North Queensland Bill Ray, adding: ‘I would be pushing for Lord Hope to be treated in the same way as this fellow.’ Mr Ward, now 41, was abused by Waddington between the ages of 11 and 15 as a chorister at Manchester Cathedral. He said: ‘It’s just incredible Lord Hope still has a position. Here is a guy who shoved it all under the carpet. 'He failed and failed to do anything and yet nothing has happened to him. He is still allowed to sit in the House of Lords.’ He added: ‘I’d like to see him punished. My opinion is that he’s committed a crime, perverting the course of justice, and should face the consequences.’ Robert Waddington died in 2007 - he had been accused of abusing seven different victims between 1955 and 1996 . Mr Ward said he left the choir when he was 15 after church officials became concerned – but the priest was allowed to remain as the dean in charge of the cathedral until 1993. Waddington then moved to York Minster, where more children were abused. He stayed in a lesser post there until 2005, despite the allegations made to Lord Hope, according to the report, which was commissioned by current Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu. Mr Ward said: ‘Here we had a church body which had been preaching at us to be morally correct yet, when it came to doing the same thing themselves, they were incapable.’ Mr Ward, now living in the Home Counties with a long-term girlfriend, added that he has put the abuse behind him. But he believes Waddington’s abuse was responsible for the death of another victim, a former chorister from Carlisle named in the report only as Peter, who was abused in the 1970s, developed depression and schizophrenia, and committed suicide in 1989. Lord Hope, 76, has described Judge Cahill’s report as ‘flawed’ but offered a ‘personal and profound apology’. He said: ‘This report makes it clear that not applying the policy is not the same as a cover-up. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.’\",\n",

       "  \"'The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime' Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, August 3, 1914 . Prime Minister David Cameron is urging Britons to switch off their lights for an hour tomorrow evening to mark the 100th anniversary of Britain’s declaration of war on Germany in 1914. The Lights Out initiative will be the culmination of a day of commemorative events across the country and in Europe, with members of the Royal Family fully involved at home and abroad. Millions of homes, offices and public and private buildings, such as Tower Bridge and 10 Downing Street, will be included in the ‘shared moment of reflection’ between 10pm and 11pm, leaving just a single candle or bulb illuminating a window as a symbol of ‘continuing hope in the darkness’. The initiative was inspired by then Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey’s remark at the outbreak of the First World War: ‘The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.’ Mr Cameron told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Lights Out is a way for everyone to mark the First World War centenary and I would encourage people to take part and turn off their lights tomorrow at 10pm for an hour, apart from a single light or candle. ‘This will be a personal gesture in remembrance of all those who made the ultimate sacrifice for us 100 years ago. They must never be forgotten.’ The national commemorations will begin with a morning service of prayers, hymns and readings in Glasgow Cathedral linked to the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games. The event will be attended by Commonwealth leaders, Mr Cameron and Prince Charles. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend a remembrance service in Liege, Belgium, before joining Prince Harry and Mr Cameron for a commemoration organised by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Mons, where the first and last British soldiers who died on the Western Front are buried. At 10pm, to coincide with the start of the ‘Lights Out’ initiative, a vigil service will be held at Westminster Abbey during which members of the congregation will extinguish candles until there is just one left alight on the tomb of the unknown soldier, which will be snuffed out by the Duchess of Cornwall. Scroll down for video . Poignant: Young drummers in Sandhurst, Berkshire, will lead a special service . During the day, there will be a number of Church of England services attended by other members of the Royal family including the Queen, who will be at Balmoral in Scotland, and Prince Philip, at Sandringham in Norfolk. Other special events will be held up and down the UK, including a commemorative service led by Sandhurst and District Corps of Drums in Berkshire. Labour’s spokesman on the First World War commemorations, Dan Jarvis, said: ‘With the busy lives we lead today, the simple act of pausing, switching off the lights and lighting a candle will be a very powerful tribute.’\",\n",
       "  \"Roy Hodgson has come under fire for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Estonia. The Liverpool star told the England manager that he was too fatigued to start the match in Tallinn after shouldering a heavy burden this season for both club and country. Hodgson then made Sterling's comments public ahead of the match, which England won 1-0 thanks to Wayne Rooney's second-half free-kick. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson: Raheem  came to me complaining of tiredness . England manager Roy Hodgson was criticised for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of Sunday's Euro 2016 win over Estonia . Sterling did not make England's starting XI in Tallinn but came on as a second-half substitute . Sterling was replaced by his Liverpool teammate Adam Lallana in the starting line-up but came on as a second-half substitute. Sky Sports pundits and former Liverpool players Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher both criticised Hodgson for not keeping their conversation private. Redknapp said: 'I would never have dreamed of saying that [I'm too tired] to an England manager, but then I picked up a lot of injuries. 'I'm sure Brendan Rodgers would have been leaning on him, [saying] you need a break and this is an opportunity to get one. 'Why on earth did Hodgson say it though? Honesty is not the best policy. Why has Roy got into this? He could have said 'I want to freshen this up.' This wouldn't even be a conversation.' Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp said Hodgson should have kept the conversation with Sterling private . Jamie Carragher, also talking on Sky Sports, agreed that Hodgson should have used more discretion . Carragher agreed that discretion would have been a better idea: 'Me as a player, I would never give a manager a chance to leave me out. 'But keep it between yourselves, just come out and say Lallana played well last game and say Raheem needs a rest. But now we are having a debate on it. 'Hodgson could have been more careful, but I don't think Rodgers would have been involved.' Sterling, 19, came off the bench to win the 74th-minute free-kick that led to England skipper Rooney curled in for his 43rd international goal. Hodgson said after the game: 'People don't like it when you simplistically tell the truth. We were training at The Grove doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically. Hodgson chats to Sterling during training on the eve of the match in Tallinn, which England won 1-0 . Sterling's Liverpool teammate Adam Lallana started in his place in the England midfield diamond . 'Just before we started, Raheem had done the warm up and he came to me and said ''look I really am feeling a bit tired, I'm not in my best form at the moment because I am feeling a bit tired''. 'So I said best thing is Adam Lallana starts the game and you rest and I have got you to bring on from the bench, simple as that. 'As you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he isn't suffering from anything. 'It was a question of having two players, who both did pretty well against San Marino and one is telling me he is a bit tired and jaded, the other one is full of beans. 'We'll put the one on who is full of beans and keep the other one up your sleeve. 'I think it would be wrong of players to try to fool me into think they are ready and that they're 100 per cent when they aren't because they are robbing somebody else of an opportunity. I thought Lallana had a good game.'\",\n",
       "  'Every frontline police officer should be offered a Taser to help fight the threat from lone-wolf terrorists, a police leader declared yesterday. Steve White, who chairs the Police Federation, said evidence of plans to murder officers made the move necessary. ‘The terrorist ideal to get attention no longer relies on an attack being in a place of note,’ he said. ‘It could be in Cheam high street, in any town, in any part of the UK. We know there are more dangerous people out there, preparing to attack police officers and we need to be able to respond to that threat.’ Steve White, who chairs the Police Federation, said evidence of plans to murder officers made it necessary for every frontline officer to be offered a taser . Leaders of the Police Federation are set to vote next month about whether every uniformed officer should be offered training in the use of a Taser . The terrorist threat level for police was raised to severe two weeks ago in the wake of the Paris atrocity and a foiled assault on officers in Belgium. Since then, police chiefs and junior officers have been considering how to counter the extra dangers. Last December, a threat was made to kidnap and kill a policeman in the West Midlands. Officers were given extra security briefings and urged not to travel to work in uniform. Leaders of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, will vote next month on a proposal that every uniformed frontline officer should be offered training in the use of Tasers, though some may choose not to carry them. The weapons, which carry an electric current of up to 50,000 volts to incapacitate dangerous suspects, have been linked to at least ten deaths in England and Wales over the past decade. Some senior officers are believed to support the idea in theory, but one police leader said chief constables would be mostly opposed. The police chief, speaking anonymously, told the Guardian: ‘The idea of arming every police officer with a Taser is alien to 200 years of police culture. It is a stepping stone to arming the police – something strapped to your hip that looks like a firearm is a huge shift in what we stand for.’',\n",
       "  \"By . Dan Bloom . It's one very, very small step for man - but a giant leap for antkind. Around 800 common ants, usually found pattering across pavements and picnics, have been sent to the International Space Station to teach scientists how they move in low gravity. Eight colonies each about the size of a tablet computer have been set up to teach experts how to build robots which interact with each other. Welcome: Nasa astronaut Rick Mastracchio greets 800 new friends aboard the International Space Station. Scientists will study how ants work together in low gravity and copy their methods to develop robots . Small steps: Each of the eight colonies is the size of a tablet computer and can be expanded to examine how the insects work together in different-sized environments . As the colonies are expanded, the ants move from small circles to straight lines to cover more ground . Houseguests: The colonies were delivered alongside Christmas presents for ISS astronauts . It is because ants inside colonies move according to internalised rules, judging how many other ants are nearby by touching antenna and using their sense of smell. Working together, the ants cover a piece of ground comprehensively to find food and supplies. When the area expands they change from moving in small circles to scuttling in straighter lines, covering more ground. But in the micro gravity of space, the ants' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work. These flexible principles could then be adapted to instruct robots to work together in the same way, for tasks like searching a burning building. Video cameras are trained on the experiment and images of the pavement ants, as they are known, are being beamed back to Earth. Close-up: The images will be beamed back to Earth. Pictured: Nasa flight engineer Mike Hopkins . Significant: The experiment could help develop robots which search disaster zones or burning buildings . These will be monitored by students at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and compared to a similar colony in their classroom. Stefanie Countryman, a professor at Bioserve Space Technologies, the private firm which launched the mission, told Bionews Texas: 'When ant densities are high, each ant thoroughly searches one small area in a circular, â€˜randomâ€™ walk. 'When ant densities are low, each ant searches by walking in a relatively straight line, allowing it to cover more ground.' The unusual cargo was delivered by an unmanned supply rocket this week which also included 28 mini-satellites known as Doves. Each less than 2ft across, they contain ultra high definition cameras which could track crop harvests, climate change and natural disasters like wildfires and floods. The cargo also included Christmas presents for those aboard the International Space Station - which were supposed to be delivered last month. The ants' launch had to be delayed several times after emergency repairs, America's 'polar vortex' of cold weather and a strong solar storm all intervened.\",\n",

Abby Miller sings for her friend Taylor Love outside Washington\\'s Union Station on Monday. She was performing outside Washington\\'s Union Station to help her 4-year-old friend, Taylor Love, who is suffering from cancer. Abby sat in front of the station with a couple of her friends, singing songs and strumming a guitar. Passers-by seemed to notice the girl\\'s singing talent, stopping to listen in the chilly weather, with a few putting money in a bucket at Abby\\'s feet. Abby said the money will help support Taylor\\'s family. A few more stopped to write messages on \"Love Notes,\" little cards designed to encourage Taylor Love through the tough time. \"Her mom reads them to her before she goes to bed at night,\" Abby said. \"Taylor gets excited for them and she loves getting them read to her because she likes knowing that people are supporting her and people are actually thinking of her.\" Taylor has neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects the nervous system. According to her Web site, she is in remission, but this type of cancer has a high risk of recurrence. There has been little research on the illness, of which there are about 650 new cases in the United States each year.

Taylor\\'s mother, Aimee, said that although Abby is eight years older than Taylor, the two see each other often and have a special connection that helps her get through her daughter\\'s illness. \"I think it\\'s amazing for a 12-year-old Abby to be drawn to my daughter, who is 4 and wants to inspire other children,\" Aimee Love said. \"The joy I see in Taylor when she sees Abby brings a light into my life.\" Taylor\\'s family said her treatments are terribly painful. But Abby said Taylor has enormous character. \"She\\'s the most happy girl in the world, which I think is just incredible,\" Abby said. \"She\\'s so much fun to be around.

       "  \"Denise Shepherd, 19, who died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs aged 11 . A teenage girl died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs when she was aged just 11, an inquest has heard. Denise Shepherd started smoking cannabis before starting secondary school and then progressed to harder drugs such as heroin. In June last year, aged 19, she was found dead in the flat she shared with her boyfriend Jamie Hayne in Eastbourne, East Sussex, when he woke in the early hours of the morning and found she had stopped breathing. At an inquest into her death at Eastbourne Magistrate's Court, her mother Joann Bell told the coroner how her daughter had moved into her flat in a bid to get her to stop taking drugs but was later joined by Mr Hayne. The pair were said to be drinking heavily and were suspected of taking drugs. However, two days before Miss Shepherd, who was unemployed, was found dead, Ms Bell moved out of the flat. She said her daughter and Mr Hayne had a volatile relationship and didn't clean up after themselves. She said: 'They became increasingly difficult to live with. 'I struggled financially because they came to me for food.' She also told the hearing how her daughter had smoked cannabis from a very early age after she had 'fallen in with the wrong crowd'. Coronor Alan Craze was also told how a neighbour had tried to administer CPR to Miss Shepherd when she was discovered unconscious. When paramedics arrived they too were unable to revive her and it is feared she may have been dead for some time. Mr Craze then recorded a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs. The inquest at Eastbourne Magistrates Court, pictured, saw Coroner Alan Craze record a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs . Speaking after the inquest, Ms Bell said she has tried to warn her daughter about the dangers of drugs. She said: 'It is so difficult. People won’t talk to their parents about drugs. 'I tried to sit down and talk to her calmly but I never was aware exactly what was going on. 'I wouldn’t have moved out if I had known. 'She was gullible, naive and easily-led. 'She would be an aunty now. Her brother is now a father. She would have loved being an aunty.'\",\n",
       "  'Las Vegas (CNN) -- The makers of Gorilla Glass, the glass that\\'s used in touchscreen gadgets such as iPhones, iPads and more than 500 other models of electronic gadgets, has officially unveiled a thinner and more touch-sensitive version of their product. When it comes to innovation in electronic gadgets, a new kind of glass is not especially sexy. But when that glass is built into millions of touchscreen devices, and could potentially make them thinner, lighter and more responsive to your finger, consumers may take notice. Corning Inc. says Gorilla Glass 2 is thinner and more touch-sensitive without sacrificing toughness or resistance to scratches. The company showed off the glass Monday at a gadget-showcase event at the International Consumer Electronics Show here and is showing live demos of its enhanced qualities at the Corning booth throughout the four-day show. The new glass is not any less resistant to breakage than the current Gorilla Glass, which may be disappointing news to anyone who has had to put up with a cracked screen after dropping a phone. \"It\\'s not scratch-proof. And if they drop it on granite, it can be broken,\" said Corning general manager Clifford Hund. But he added that Corning has managed to make the glass 20% thinner but just as strong -- a key advancement at a time when smartphone and tablet makers are trying to produce ever-thinner devices. The second generation of Gorilla Glass will debut in Windows-based PCs this year. Other manufacturers also are weighing how and when to add the glass to their upcoming devices, Hund said. Because it\\'s thinner -- about 0.8 millimeters instead of 1 millimeter -- the glass allows users\\' fingers to be closer to the touch interface, creating a screen that responds more quickly and accurately, said Gorilla Glass program director Jaymin Amin. The glass also has been engineered to let more light through, creating a brighter display screen, Corning executives said. Due to customer nondisclosure agreements, Corning cannot name all the devices that use Gorilla Glass -- including Apple products. But according to multiple other sources, including Walter Isaacson\\'s recent biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the product\\'s first consumer application was the original iPhone in 2007. A passage from Isaacson\\'s book details how Apple had originally planned to use plastic display coverings for its iPhone before Jobs approached Corning CEO Wendell Weeks about ordering glass instead. Weeks told him Corning had developed a tough form of glass, made extra strong by a chemical process, but couldn\\'t find a market for it. Weeks didn\\'t think Corning could manufacture the glass fast enough to meet Apple\\'s timetable for the iPhone launch. But at the prodding of Jobs, who wouldn\\'t take no for an answer, Corning did it in six months. After the iPhone hit the market, Jobs sent Weeks a note that said, \"We couldn\\'t have done it without you.\" Gorilla Glass also is part of touchscreens in electronic devices by Acer, Asus, Dell, HTC, LG, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung and Sony, among other manufacturers. Amin demonstrated its toughness Monday by placing a small square of the original glass in a lever press, then applying more than 100 pounds of pressure onto it. Despite looking like he was truly exerting himself, he couldn\\'t break it. Amin then tested the new glass the same way and got the same result.',\n",

The British-based marque has won 50 grands prix, four constructor titles and four drivers\\' world championships in its 10-year history. The spoils of this success had been on display in the reception to its factory, which is based on an industrial estate in Milton Keynes, England. \"We are obviously devastated by this serious factory break-in, which saw offenders drive a vehicle through our front entrance and steal more than 60 trophies which took years and hard work to accumulate,\" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement. \"The break in caused significant damage and was very upsetting for our night officers who were on duty at the time. \"Beyond the aggressive nature of this break in, we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies. \"The value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one. But their intrinsic value is low; they would be of little benefit to those outside of the team and, in addition to that, many of the trophies on display were replicas.\" Smash and grab . Thames Valley Police are investigating the incident which took place just before 01:30 Friday. A statement by the police, who are appealing for witnesses, detailed the robbery was carried out by around six men. \"Two cars were involved in the burglary,\" the statement added. \"A silver 4x4 which was used to drive through the entrance and a further dark colored, black or dark blue Mercedes estate car. Both are believed to have foreign number plates.\" Red Bull said it would be review access to its factory following the incident.

       "  'Los Angeles (CNN) -- \"Teflon Don\" rapper Rick Ross crashed his silver Rolls Royce into an apartment building after he heard gunfire along a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, street Monday morning, police said. \"The driver of the Rolls Royce attempted to drive away from the direction of the shots being fired and lost control of the vehicle, striking a nearby apartment building,\" Fort Lauderdale Police Detective DeAnna Garcia said. Ross and a female passenger were not hurt by the wreck or the gunshots, Garcia said. \"The suspects fled from the area prior to police arrival,\" she said. The incident, however, called attention to threats against the artist\\'s life made in a street gang\\'s videos and posted online in recent months. \"We\\'re pulling up on you,\" a man who identified himself as a member of the Gangster Disciples warned in one of the videos. \"Whatever city, whatever state, the pressure on.\" Several videos purporting to be from Gangster Disciple members in several states -- including Georgia, North Carolina and Florida -- appeared on YouTube late last year demanding that Ross pay a fee to them for his use of the Star of David, which they claim as a gang symbol, and a reference to one of their founders in his music and marketing. \"You got to cut the check,\" one video said. \"Tell your boss man he got to get that check, or all you in trouble.\" \"We need that cash right now,\" another said. Ross, 37, whose albums include \"Teflon Don\" in 2010 and \"Deeper Than Rap\" a year earlier, told south Florida radio station 99 Jamz last month that he was not intimidated by the threats. \"Ain\\'t never no checks getting cut,\" he said. \"I don\\'t play those games. I consider that extortion.\" Is Nas hip-hop\\'s finest MC? Ross did cancel his North Carolina shows last month just days after a video appeared online threatening his life if he performed there. \"Never was it due to any threats,\" he told the radio station. Instead, he canceled because \"the promoter wasn\\'t really handling his business.\" Ross wanted to make certain that listeners understood he was not frightened. \"Don\\'t ever get it twisted, Ricky Ross is the boss,\" he said. The death threats are not the only challenge to Ross. A former drug lord and gang leader is suing in a Los Angeles court, accusing him of stealing his name and reputation. \"The reality is I want justice done,\" the original Ross wrote in an e-mail to CNN. \"I know that he took his name and image from my life and believe he is unfairly profiting off my story.\" Ricky \"Freeway\" Ross was serving a prison sentence a decade ago when rapper William Roberts, who previously worked as a Florida correctional officer, adopted \"Rick Ross\" as his stage name, according to the lawsuit. \"This rapper and his labels clearly knew of my name and story, and have tried to suck out the lifeblood without license,\" the former drug lord said. \"I have my own use for my intellectual property and did not need this confusion created.\" More recently, the rapper has been using the name \"Ricky Rozay.\" The rapper and his record label have not responded to CNN\\'s request for comment.

       "  'LIKE James Bond, Sir Roger Moore has at times enjoyed a martini. But the actor has revealed he can no longer drink the cocktail because of his Type 2 diabetes. Sir Roger, 86, was diagnosed with the condition last year, and it means he has to watch the amount of sugar and alcohol he consumes. A martini is a highly alcoholic cocktail, made from a combination of gin and vermouth. And it was Bond’s drink of choice when Sean Connery played the spy. Shaken not stirred: Sir Roger Moore, who starred in seven James Bond films, drinks a martini in 1968 . Opening up about his health condition, Sir Roger said: ‘I make a very good dry martini but I’m not allowed to drink them any more. No more sugar, no alcohol. I get to taste the wine and I can make a little sip last an hour. I enjoy it much more. I remember a lot more of what happened.’ Typically a martini is a gin-based drink, although it can also be made with vodka. In the 007 films Bond is known for ordering his martinis ‘shaken not stirred’, referring to the way in which they are made. The cocktail can also be made ‘with a twist’, which involves lemon peel, or ‘dirty’, where it contains olive brine. It was Connery’s Bond who drank martinis, Sir Roger explained, first uttering the ‘shaken not stirred’ catchphrase in Goldfinger. Sir Roger (pictured in 2013) was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes last year and can no longer drink martinis . In the past Sir Roger has admitted having a taste for champagne. These days, however, he sticks to soft drinks, claiming his ‘vice’ to be Diet Coke. And he has come up a guilt-free virgin cocktail – a Band Aid – which is a combination of non-alcoholic beer and Diet Coke. ‘No calories and it’s delicious,’ Sir Roger said. Giving an interview to the Sunday Telegraph the actor, who starred in seven James Bond films, went on to joke that he would indulge in martinis and ice cream if he knew he only had one day left to live. He said: ‘When I’m told I’ve got 24 hours to go, I’m going to have a couple of dry martinis with Tanqueray gin - not vodka - and a couple of choc ices with plain chocolate on the outside and white, white vanilla on the inside - oh, and baked beans.’ Sir Roger, who last appeared as 007 almost 30 years ago, revealed he had been diagnosed with diabetes last year. He had collapsed at home in Monaco and been rushed into hospital by his fourth wife Kristina Tholstrup. Doctors confirmed that the star, who had been losing weight for some time, was suffering from the condition. Appearing on US TV’s Late Show with David Letterman ‘I went to the doctor, and he said, “You know those high blood-sugar numbers you’ve been dealing with since you were 36? Well, you’ve graduated! You’ve got Type 2 diabetes, young man”.’ In the past Sir Roger has survived prostate cancer and had a pacemaker inserted.',\n",
       "  'LONDON, England -- Scientists in the U.S. are developing a laser gun that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes. The WHO has reported that around half of the world\\'s population is at risk of malaria. The laser, which has been dubbed a \"weapon of mosquito destruction\" fires at mosquitoes once it detects the audio frequency created by the beating of its wings. The laser beam then destroys the mosquito, burning it on the spot. Developed  by some of the astrophysicists involved in what was known as the \"Star Wars\" anti-missile programs during the Cold War, the project is meant to prevent the spread of malaria. Lead scientist on the project, Dr. Jordin Kare, told CNN that the laser would be able to sweep an area and \"toast millions of mosquitoes in a few minutes.\" Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people from the bites of female mosquitoes. It is particularly prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and kills an African child every 30 seconds, according to the World Health Organization. There are an estimated 300 million acute cases of malaria each year globally, resulting in more than one million deaths, the WHO reports. Responding to questions about any potential harm the laser could pose to the eco-system, Kare said: \"There is no such thing as a good mosquito, there\\'s nothing that feeds exclusively on them. No one would miss mosquitoes,\" he said. \"In any case,\" he added. \"The laser is able to distinguish between mosquitoes that go after people and those that aren\\'t dangerous. What remains to be seen is how precise we can get.\" He added that other insects would not be affected by the laser\\'s beam. Kare said the lasers could be mounted on lamp post-type poles and put around the circumference of villages, to create a kind of \"fence\" against mosquitoes. The research was commissioned by Intellectual Ventures, a Washington, U.S.-based company that was founded by Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft Corporation executive. His previous boss, Bill Gates, who funded the research, asked Myhrvold to look into new ways of combating malaria.',\n",
       "  \"New York Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda has been suspended for 10 games after being caught using pine tar to help him grip the ball. The commissioner's office announced the penalty. The ban was to start for Thursday night's game in Boston unless Pineda appealed. There was no immediate word on whether Pineda would challenge the suspension. Suspicious substance: Michael Pineda was ejected from the game after umpires found a foreign substance on his neck . Pineda was . ejected in the second inning of Wednesday night's 5-1 loss at Fenway . Park after umpires found the pine tar on his neck. After the game, Pineda admitted he had used the pine tar to help him hold the ball on a cool, windy night. 'I'll learn from this mistake,' he said. 'It won't happen again.' Pine . tar is a sticky substance that baseball players will often put on the . handles of their bats to improve grip. Pitchers will use it for the same . reason, particularly in cold weather. However, MLB rules say that a . pitcher can't put any foreign substance on the ball because it can . potentially make the ball move more when a pitcher throws a curve ball. So pitchers will often try and hide it. If they get caught, they are . typically thrown out of the game - and that's exactly what happened to . Pineda. Scroll down for video . Busted: The substance was clearly visible on the pitcher's neck . The . right-hander was thrown out in the second inning when plate umpire . Gerry Davis found the substance on the right side of Pineda's neck after . Red Sox manager John Farrell asked him to check. Pineda walked from the . mound without protest. Both Pineda and Davis said it was pine tar. 'When . it's that obvious, something has got to be said,' Farrell explained . after the game. 'Our awareness was heightened, given what we had seen in . the past.' The ejection also set off a debate in the baseball world about pitchers who use pine tar, and whether it should be allowed in certain circumstances. Many former aces said they had done it, albeit in a more discreet manner. Rule 8.02(b) prohibits pitchers from altering the ball to gain an unfair advantage, and forbids them from having a foreign substance on them or in their possession on the mound. Pineda wasn't seen with the pine tar in the first inning, when the Red Sox roughed him up. Boston manager John Farrell asked plate umpire Gerry Davis to check Pineda after two fast outs the next inning. Got ya: Umpire Gerry Davis determined that the substance on Pineda's neck was pine tar, which is against the rules for pitchers . Earlier . this month, Pineda pitched well against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. Television cameras showed a substance on his hand during that outing â€” Pineda said it was dirt, not pine tar. Among . other suspensions of pitchers for pine tar in the past decade, Tampa . Bay's Joel Peralta was penalized eight games in 2012, the Angels' Brendan Donnelly 10 days in 2005 and St. Louis' Julian Tavarez 10 days . in 2004. The suspensions of Donnelly and Tavarez were cut to eight days . after they asked the players' association to appeal, and Peralta dropped . his challenge with no reduction. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Pineda and the organization were 'embarrassed.' Yankees manager Joe Girardi called it 'an error in judgment' and a 'little bump' and 'poor judgment.' 'He had a hard time gripping the baseball. Unknown to us, he put it on and went out there,' Girardi said. 'It's a young kid. I don't think he's trying to do anything, cheat. I think he's just trying to go out there and compete.' Obvious: Boston manager John Farrell said that when it's as obvious as it was on Pineda, he has to alert the umpires . In Pineda's previous start against the Red Sox, a 4-1 Yankees win in New York on April 10, television cameras caught Pineda with what appeared to be sticky pine tar on his hand on a cool night. Farrell didn't see a photograph of Pineda's hand until the fourth inning; when Pineda came out to warm up for the fifth, his hand was clean. Pineda said the dark substance was dirt but it sparked debate about pitchers' use of sticky substances to get a better grip on cool nights. On Wednesday, with the game time temperature at 50 degrees, Sizemore started the first with a triple and scored on Dustin Pedroia's single. With one out, Mike Napoli singled Pedroia to third. After Mike Carp flied to left, A.J. Pierzynski singled up the middle, scoring Pedroia. After Pineda's ejection, David Phelps came in and completed the strikeout of Sizemore. Trend: A similar brown, sticky substance was seen on Pineda's hand in another game against Boston on April 10 . John Lackey (3-2) allowed one run and seven hits in eight innings with 11 strikeouts and no walks. Koji Uehara struck out three in the ninth in a non-save situation. The previous time Lackey faced the Yankees he allowed four homers in a 7-2 loss on April 12. On Wednesday, he struck out the side in the third then had two strikeouts in each of the next two innings. Mike Napoli had three hits and Boston scored two runs in the first and two more in the third. The Yankees scored on Alfonso Soriano's sacrifice fly in the sixth.\",\n",

Dr. Jorge Mario Gonzalez, 56, was chief of the critical care section at Houston\\'s Methodist Hospital and \"a pulmonary medicine leader,\" according to the hospital system\\'s Web site. He was found dead Saturday when deputies responded to a 911 call of a burglary in progress shortly after noon, said Austin County Sheriff\\'s Office spokesman Sgt. Paul Faircloth. The responding officer was met by vehicles leaving the location, Faircloth said, and a person in one vehicle fired on the officer. The officer and his car were not struck, and the officer did not return fire, Faircloth said. The officer was able to provide a detailed description of the vehicles, he said. At the home, which Faircloth said is in a rural, wooded and isolated area, officers found Gonzalez shot to death and another person wounded. The second victim was airlifted to an Austin, Texas, hospital.  Watch Dr. Gonzalez\\'s son talk about his father » . Gonzalez\\'s wife and small child were found unharmed inside the home, Faircloth said. CNN affiliate KHOU identified the woman as Charleen Gonzalez, 29, and the couple\\'s 2-year-old son, and reported the two hid in a closet. Authorities do not know whether the incident was a burglary or an intended home invasion, Faircloth said, and \"we do not know if this is random or targeted.\" Several leads were being followed Monday morning, he said, and numerous agencies were involved in the investigation. The motive for the killing had not been determined on Monday. The slaying took place at Gonzalez\\'s ranch outside Bellville, Texas, said Lisa Block, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. Gonzalez, his wife and child arrived at the ranch about 11 a.m. Saturday, she said, and \"the suspects were at the house when they arrived.\" Gonzalez\\'s wife ran inside with the child and called 911, she said. Ranch worker Noel Galvan was the second victim, Block said. He was listed in critical condition, she said. Faircloth said earlier Monday five suspects were being sought, but later said police were seeking four. The vehicles seen leaving the home were a late \\'90s white Ford F-150 pickup, occupied by two Hispanic males, Faircloth said, and a red Honda or Acura with dark tinted windows sitting low to the ground, with one Hispanic male inside. The shots were fired from the white pickup, he said. Another vehicle mentioned earlier Monday was a two-toned silver and black Ford F-150 that had two Hispanic males inside. Faircloth said Monday afternoon that vehicle had been located and was not thought to be involved. However, police released a video of a gray Lexus on Monday, and would like to question its owners, Faircloth said. The drivers are believed to be an older couple. The car was seen before the officer encountered the white and red vehicles. \"The manhunt continues on the ground,\" Faircloth said. The suspects are considered armed and dangerous, he said. Faircloth said he had no information on whether the home had surveillance equipment. Family members told KHOU that Gonzalez went to the ranch nearly every weekend. \"It\\'s deeply saddening for all of us,\" an older son of Gonzalez, Juan Mauricio Gonzalez, told KHOU. \"We are a tight-knit family and he was just a perfect man, a perfect father and a great physician.\" The Methodist Hospital System said Gonzalez will be missed, \"both as a friend and an outstanding clinician and researcher. Our prayers and thoughts go out to his family during this tragedy.\" \"This man had nothing to do with anybody,\" Juan Gonzalez told KHOU. \"He was a peaceful man. He was a wise man. He was just here to make people better and nothing else.\" A reward totaling $26,000 was offered for information in the case leading to an arrest.

I am bigger than Mayweather in a lot of places and I can help him become more famous, and earn more money.’ Khan isn’t worried that 36-year-old Mayweather could catch him out. Khan was all smiles as he talked to the assembled press at his gym in Bolton . Khan is hoping his next fight will be against Floyd Mayweather next year . ‘Mayweather throws maybe three hundred punches in a fight, I could manage that in a single round,’ he said. ‘Floyd will never hurt me. I have been knocked down in other fights but Mayweather is not the biggest puncher, not as big as Alexander. Our fight would be like a game of chess, hit-move. It would be about footwork and accuracy, nothing more, nothing less. ‘I speak to legends like Roy Jones and Thomas Hearns and they say I would beat him. Even the taxi driver I spoke to in Vegas said he hoped I would knock him out. The people there want to see him humbled . ‘But Floyd is the boss. If he doesn’t want to fight me, he won’t. He’s not the type of guy where I could just turn up to his house and have a chat about it. But maybe all this stuff about me not being a big name is a sign he might be interested, he is starting to promote the fight. I don’t think him and Pacquiao will happen.’ Khan’s homecoming to England after wowing the Vegas fans has been bittersweet. His friend Anthony Crolla, who trains in the same gym, suffered a fractured skull and broken ankle after being hit on the head by a concrete slab as he confronted burglars. Khan lands a left hand during his impressive win on decision against Alexander . Khan arrived back in Manchester along with his wife and daughter on Wednesday . Mayweather says Khan's 'name holds no weight' and that he will not fight him . And the terrorist attack that killed 132 schoolchildren in Pakistan, where Khan’s family originate from, has also affected him badly. The £30,000 pair of shorts he wore at the weekend, containing a gold waistband, will be auctioned off to raise funds for the survivors. Talking about Crolla, Khan revealed that he had volunteered to be his pal’s sparring partner ahead of his world lightweight title shot against Richar Abril in Manchester on January 23, which has now been cancelled . ‘Me and Crolla are good friends,’ said Khan. ‘I roomed with him as an amateur. ‘His trainer Joe Gallagher was at my fight in Vegas and I told him I would spar with Crollar to help him because Abril is a long fighter, and I have got long arms, I can replicate his style. It is probable that Mayweather will insist on fighting Pacquiao, an eight-division champion, in his adopted hometown of Las Vegas . FLOYD MAYWEATHER . Age 37 . Born Michigan, USA .

I feel really bad, they have taken away his dream of fighting for a world title and tried to ruin his life, over nothing.’ Khan admits there must be doubts over whether Crolla can fight again. ‘When you have suffered something that bad, you have to understand the Board might not give him a license. It is very dangerous, is it worth that risk? ‘We fighters, even me in his position, would want to fight again, but sometimes you have to think of your health first.’ The attack on Crolla follows a knife attack on another potential Khan opponent, Kell Brook, in Tenerife earlier this year. The two incidents were totally unconnected but Khan says he is always conscious of trying to stay away from trouble outside boxing. ‘I don’t like fighting, I only do it when I am in the ring,’ he said.\",\n",
       "  'Clearly Jesus was sexy. After all, He is the Son of God. I don\\'t mean to be disrespectful, but as I watched the trailer for the new movie, \"Son of God,\" I found myself gawking at the actor portraying Jesus. Diogo Morgado is one hot dude. His Jesus looks more like Brad Pitt than that nice man with the beard in all those paintings. I\\'m not the only one gawking at Morgodo\\'s Jesus. He inspired the hashtag, \"#HotJesus\". It went viral on Twitter. The actor told The New York Times he doesn\\'t want his looks to distract from the movie, but, \"If the message of Jesus was love, hope and compassion, and I can bring that to more people by being a more appealing Jesus, I am happy with that.\" Clearly we have a new trend. A \"more appealing\" Jesus is not just a better prophet, he\\'s ... sexy. We actually don\\'t know what Jesus looked like. We do know he was a carpenter, so perhaps Jesus was buff. But, I don\\'t think when the Biblical Nathaniel asked, \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" and Phillip answered, \"Come and see,\" they were talking about Jesus\\' beautiful face or chiseled abs. Yes, Jesus, as portrayed in countless paintings, has a six-pack. As comedian and author, Greg Behrendt joked, \"I\\'d like to get ripped ... ripped like Jesus. Jesus was ripped. You\\'ve seen the pictures, right? He\\'s ripped! Ripped. He\\'s the son of God. He\\'s not going to be walking around saying I\\'ve got back fat today, I\\'m so puffy.\" All joking aside, why must Jesus be sexy? Or ripped? Or even handsome? The Rev. Robert B. Lawton, SJ, a Jesuit priest and former president of Loyola Marymount University, says, \"There is absolutely no indication that Jesus was good-looking and sexy. In fact there is a passage in the prophet Isaiah that is taken as referring to Jesus.  It says this: . \"He had no form or majesty that we should look at him/nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.\" (Isaiah 53. 2-3.) While this might not be conclusive evidence, it\\'s quite possible that Jesus was no Jewish Brad Pitt from Palestine. On the other hand, why wouldn\\'t God create a perfect Son? \"Anything that is sexy is going to attract people. People who might not go to the movie might want to check it out, particularly non-Christians,\" says the Rev. Lisa Jenkins, senior pastor of St. Matthew\\'s Baptist Church in Harlem. \"I don\\'t see a problem with Jesus being attractive given our cultural context,\" she says. \"I don\\'t recall a Jesus who was not appealing to the eye. That\\'s Hollywood.\" Jenkins is more concerned about what she considers an inaccurate portrayal of Jesus\\' ethnicity. The Rev. James Martin, SJ, editor-at-large for America Magazine, and author of the coming book, \"Jesus: A Pilgrimage,\" agrees. \"God did not choose to incarnate himself in Laguna Beach,\" he says. \"He chose to incarnate Himself at a certain place, at a certain time in a certain person.\"  And that person was a Palestinian Jew. \"Many people have a hard time with the humanity of Jesus ... the closer He is to human physical  perfection, the easier it is for some to accept Him.\" But, Martin says, there is a danger in that too. A physically perfect Jesus makes Him into a God pretending to be man.  When Jesus was both human and divine. \"He was like us in all things, except sin, as the theology goes,\" Martin says. \"That means, He had a body, He got sick, He got tired, He may have sprained an ankle or two. There are passages in the Gospel showing Him falling asleep because He was tired. We tend to airbrush the physical imperfections away.\" Those traits make Jesus so much more accessible. So much more ... human. I tried to come up with a living person to compare to Jesus. That, of course, is impossible. The closest I can come, as a Catholic, is Pope Francis. I\\'ve grown to revere him. Is it because he\\'s sexy? In a word: No.',\n",
       "  'By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 6:52 PM on 10th July 2011 . Theirs is more than just your average boy-meets-girl story. It\\'s a New York love story, with a very modern twist. Allen Sheinman, 58, and his wife Collette Stallone, 56, said they know the secret to a happy and successful marriage - live in separate homes. For the first four years of wedded bliss the quirky couple - who met online - lived apart, she in Greenwich Village and he in West 23rd street in Manhattan. Secret: Collette Stallone said she believes marriage is a state of mind and doesn\\'t see why two people have to live together . Force: Allen Sheinman said he didn\\'t want to both get married and lived together but the recession drove them to cohabit . Allen - a managing editor at a trade publication - said: \\'We consider seventh avenue a long hallway between our two domiciles.\\' But hard times hit as it did with many New Yorkers and when Allen\\'s boss raised his rent to $1,800 a month, the couple did the unthinkable - they moved in together. Allen said: \\'It was really a financial move to cohabit. Now we are transitioning into real-time marriage. This is it.\\' Speaking about living together - or not living together - Allen said it was an arrangement they were both comfortable with. He said: \\'I told her I could handle getting married and living together, just not both. And to my relief she said, \"OK let\\'s get married and keep our own places\". That\\'s what I was hoping for.\\' Colette said: \\'When you\\'re young you think, \"Oh, . we’re in love,\" all that. But when you get older, you say, \"You know, I . love you, but I need my space\".\\' Expensive: Allen leaves his spacious apartment on West 23rd street because the rent was increased to $1,800 . Tight squeeze: There is barely room for Collette\\'s stuff in her Greenwich Village apartment nevermind her husbands . When Allen moved into Colette\\'s tiny one-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment, where she has been for 31 years, even then they weren\\'t prepared to fully live together. Instead of embracing cohabitation, the couple drew up battle lines, put up invisible walls and lay down a set of ground rules. According to the New York Post, there was no crossing into each other\\'s space without permission, she had her own bedroom - where she generously said he could sleep at weekends - and he slept in a sofa bed in the living room. The end?: The couple are still blissfully in love after four years of marriage and living apart but will cohabiting change that? They have their own newspaper and magazine subscriptions,\\' watch their own TV shows from their own space and even have a shower rota. The kitchen - which also hosts the apartment\\'s only shower - is the only place that is allowed for both couples any time of the day or night. Colette - a retired high-school teacher who now runs her home-made jewellery business - believes that not living together was the secret to their happy marriage. \\'Getting married is a state of mind, I don\\'t see why we have to live together. I don\\'t need to see him brush his teeth,\\' she told the Post. \\'It\\'s bad enough I see him brush his hair. \\'I don’t know where this idea came from that you always have to be in the middle of whatever the other person is doing.\\' Alarmingly, she said when she told her ex-husband they were now living together he said: \\'I give it four months.\\' The couple are featured in a documentary titled \\'Two\\'s a crowd\\' which will have its New York premiere at the Rooftop Films Summer Series on July 21.',\n",
       "  \"By . Associated Press . and Reuters . Honey mixed with sugar might be sweet, but it is not 'honey.' The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real deal. New guidance issued Tuesday would prevent food companies from adding sugar or other sweeteners to pure honey and still calling it 'honey.' Funny honey: The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real deal . The agency said enforcement action is possible against U.S. food businesses or importers if companies try to cut those sweeteners into real honey and do not label the product correctly. If those sweeteners are added, the label should read 'blend of sugar and honey' or 'blend of honey and corn syrup.' The FDA regularly detains honey imports and tests them after finding drug residues and unlabeled added sweeteners. Only manufactures that do not add sugar, corn syrup or other sweeteners should label their products as pure 'honey,' the FDA said in draft guidelines posted online. The proposal aims 'to advise the regulated food industry on the proper labeling of honey and honey products to help ensure that honey and honey products are not adulterated or misbranded,' the agency wrote. Americans consume more than 400 million pounds of honey each year, according to U.S. government and industry estimates. New rules: The guidance, released Tuesday, would stop food companies from putting sugar or other sweeteners into pure honey and still referring to it as honey . But just 149 million pounds were produced in the United States last year, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed. To feed America's sweet tooth, much honey is imported, and U.S. producers are worried about cheap substitutes. Pure honey is generally more expensive than those mixed with corn syrup and traditional sugar, and prices reached a record high of $2.12 a pound last year, according to the USDA. The FDA's review follows a petition from the American Beekeeping Federation and several other related groups seeking a standard U.S. definition for the natural sweetener to promote fair trade.While the agency rejected their request, it said it was willing to look at labeling. Sticky situation: If sweeteners are added, the label should read 'blend of sugar and honey' or 'blend of honey and corn syrup' The FDA inspected imported honey to see whether it had been 'adulterated' with corn or cane sugars. In recent decades, it detained honey containing such substitutes from countries such as Brazil and Mexico, according to the agency. Manufacturers have 60 days to comment on the proposal before final guidelines are issued. Even then, however, guidelines are not mandatory.\",\n",
       "  \"By . Lizzie Edmonds . William Henry Welch, 53, escaped punishment for driving without licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car . A star of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding escaped punishment for driving without insurance after his wife checked his documentation as he can 'barely read', a court heard. William Henry Welch, 53, avoided six penalty points on his driving licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car, a court was told. Welch told Magistrates he asked his wife to look at his documents as he struggles with reading. He was granted an absolute discharge after admitting driving without insurance at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court. Welch is a well-known campaigner for traveller and gipsy rights - and has appeared on My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding among other reality shows. Speaking after the case Welch said: 'It isn’t all doom and gloom when you go to these courts, if you go and you have a reasonable argument the magistrates are willing to listen. 'You should never just give up and think that they won’t listen to you because they will.' The court heard how Welch’s own car had broken down when he was working in Leominster, Herefordshire, and a friend loaned him a Vauxhall Vectra to drive back home. Welch told the court he had rung his wife, Rachel, to check he was covered to drive the Vectra. After reading the insurance policy she told him that he was. Welch of Darlington, Durham, told the court he left insurance documents to his wife because: 'I can barely read.' Mrs Welch, 49, told the court: 'We were both named on the insurance document and so I thought we were both policy holders.' Andrea Milson, prosecuting, told the court that as policyholder, Mrs Welch was covered to drive any car. However, as Mr Welch was a named driver he was only covered to drive the family car and not the borrowed Vectra. Welch, a well-known Gypsy campaigner, told the court he asked his wife to look at his documentation as he can 'barely read'. He has starred in numerous television shows including My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding . The car was stopped by police on the A456 in Worcestershire last August and Welch was subsequently charged with driving with no insurance and no MoT. Welch admitted both charges but, in a rare ‘special reasons hearing’, his solicitor, David Dedman, argued that the licence should not be endorsed with the usual six penalty points. 'This was an honest mistake,' said Mr Dedman. 'He genuinely believed he was insured and was misled by his wife, not deliberately or intentionally.' Magistrates granted Welch an absolute discharge on the matter of no insurance. They imposed no penalty points, but he was ordered to pay costs of £85. He was fined a further £100 for the offence of driving a vehicle with no MoT test certificate. Paddy Doherty walked free from court after headbutting his stepbrother in March . In March, Paddy Doherty, 55,\\xa0 walked free from court after admitting he headbutted his stepbrother. The 55-year-old breached the terms of a suspended jail sentence when he committed the assault at a pub in Flintshire, north Wales, in October 2013. He was given a six-month supervision order\\xa0 instead of jail time. The 2011 winner of Celebrity Big Brother had previously been handed a 31-week jail term, suspended for two years, in January 2012, after he brawled in the street with a fellow traveller. The show's infamous dressmaker Thelma Madine was sued by her head designer for unfair dismissal at the end of 2013. A court ruled Ms Madine dismissed Leanne Phillips, who was paid £400 a week to design dresses for the Nico Bridal Company, based in Liverpool, after a heated row. Ms Madine fired the 31-year-old, who she had previously praised with taking her business to 'another level' after six years.\",\n",

Google:\\xa0The parcel Google purchased is zoned for nearly 900,000 square feet of commercial space that could house offices or studios holding as many as 6,000 workers . City Councilman Mike Bonin, who represents the area, said the purchase 'brands Playa Vista as the tech and innovation capital of Los Angeles.' The Mountain View-based tech giant wouldn't detail its plans for the properties. Last year Microsoft opened a 20,000-square-foot space in Playa Vista, a neighborhood near major freeways, several neighborhoods and Los Angeles International Airport. Facebook has operations nearby, as do other major media companies and ad agencies. Three years ago, Google opened a campus in Venice, where it leased 100,000 square feet in three buildings for about 600 employees.

       "  '(CNN) -- Investigators Wednesday exhumed the body of a 7-year-old Illinois girl slain more than five decades ago in hopes that modern science will bolster the case against the man now accused of killing her. The remains of Maria Ridulph, dead since 1957, were exhumed for tests as the 71-year-old suspect in her killing was headed back to Illinois from Seattle, DeKalb County State\\'s Attorney Clay Campbell told reporters. \"Suffice to say science has advanced greatly, thankfully, since that time and we\\'re hoping that advancement in science can assist us in our investigation of this case,\" Campbell said. Ridulph disappeared while playing with a friend near her home in Sycamore, Illinois, about 60 miles west of Chicago. Her body was found five months later and 120 miles away. Jack Daniel McCullough, the man now facing murder charges in her death, was an early suspect in the disappearance but had an alibi: He told police that he was at a military recruiting station in Rockford, Illinois, about 20 miles away, the evening Ridulph was reported missing. McCullough told investigators he had been given a train ticket from Rockford to Chicago by the military, then returned home and went on a date with his girlfriend. But when police interviewed the woman again in 2010 and asked if she had any photos of McCullough, she discovered an unused train ticket from Rockford to Chicago that she said he had given her on the date of the crime. The discovery led to McCullough\\'s arrest in Seattle in early July. Campbell said Wednesday that McCullough was en route to Illinois from Washington state to face murder charges in Ridulph\\'s death. Maria\\'s brother, Charles Ridulph, appeared at a news conference with Campbell and said the family had agreed to the exhumation. \"Although the events were very difficult and very unsettling, we understand the necessity for these things, and we are in complete agreement and thankful for the way this case is being handled,\" he said.',\n",

Rumours are circulating that Sony is preparing to launch its next generation games console soon after the Japanese tech giant sent out invitations to an event on 'the future of PlayStation.' Sony would not say whether it was preparing to unveil the successor to the 70million selling PS3 at the February 20 meeting in New York, but the prospect had gamers abuzz on Twitter. 'We will be talking about the PlayStation business,' Sony spokesman Masaki Tsukakoshi said today. Tantalising: A still from the video Sony released to drum up excitement over its PlayStation announcement . Despite that, the scale of the excitement over the meeting was indicated by a Google search for 'Sony Feb 20 PlayStation' which returned more than 7million hits. The last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011, it presented a protoype of its handheld Vita console. Before that, it convened a gathering in 2005 two months after it first demonstrated the PS3 concept. A meeting in 1999 revealed designs for the PS2. It has been more than six years since Sony launched the PS3 home console, a longer gap than between it and its PS2 predecessor, adding to the anticipation that it will soon disclose its next gaming concept. Current generation: Sony's super-slim . PlayStation 3 has been on the market for more than six years, selling some 70million units, making the . Japanese technology firm long overdue a new flagship product launch . Despite remaining tight-lipped about the specific purpose of the press conference, the company published a teaser video about the meeting on YouTube which has already been viewed more than 400,000 times in less than 24 hours. The video also promoted a Twitter hashtag, #Playstation2013, to which video game fans flocked to share their excitement about the forthcoming event.

Such a console would follow Nintendo's Wii U, which launched last autumn, and precede Microsoft's next Xbox game console, which will likely be unveiled in June at the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles. The PlayStation Vita: The portable console, successor to the PSP, was unveiled the last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011 . Since Sony's last home console launch, the games market has been transformed by the boom in smartphones and tablet computers that have wooed players with free or cheap games. Sony and its video game rivals Nintendo and Microsoft now have to contend with competition from powerful hand-held devices made by Apple, Samsung and a string of others. Analysts expect that tablets and other mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today's games consoles within a few years. Many are already able to run the kinds of 3D games that were once the exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high-spec gaming PCs. Struggling under competitive pressure, Nintendo on Wednesday cut its sales target for the Wii U, successor to its 100million-selling Wii, to 4million machines by the end of March from its launch in November.

And he went even further on his next show, saying: 'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.' In addition, Barack Obama said he considered Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks'.

Ms Fluke was due to testify at a . hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that . health insurers provide contraception. The Senate yesterday defeated a GOP effort to roll back President Barack Obama's policy on contraception insurance coverage. It was the first vote on an issue that has raised controversy on religious and women's rights. The close 51-48 vote killed an amendment to allow employers and insurers to opt out of portions of the President's health care law they found morally objectionable. But committee chairman Darrell Issa of . California said she could not testify at the hearing as it was focused . on threats to religious freedom. Ms Fluke later put her testimony on . YouTube and spoke about a friend who had to take birth control to treat a . disorder that caused ovarian cysts. The friend subsequently lost her . ovary. She also spoke of classmates who can’t afford contraception, . which was what really riled Mr Limbaugh. Ms Fluke claimed a female student spends $3,000 on protected sex during a three-year course at university, reported ABC News. ‘Three thousand dollars for birth . control in three years? That’s $1,000 a year of sex - and, she wants us . to pay for it,’ Mr Limbaugh said. Spokesman: Ms Fluke was due to testify at a hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that health insurers provide contraception - but she wasn't allowed to do so . Another target: Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick earlier this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage . 'She's having so much sex she can't . afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should . provide them, or the Pope.’ Should U.S. university students' health insurance cover birth control costs? Female rights activists were left . seething and two Democrats walked out of the Capitol Hill hearing last . month after it was led by an all-male panel. Ms Fluke did eventually speak about . birth control at a Democratic hearing led by House Minority Leader Nancy . Pelosi last week, reported ABC News. She is a third-year law student at Georgetown and ex-president of the Students for Reproductive Justice group at the university. Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage.

A mother has shed more than half her body weight for the festive season after being disgusted by a photo taken at a Christmas party last year. Carol Bryant, 42, from Brighton, was 'horrified' by her 21 stone frame when she saw a photo of herself socialising with a friend. The full-time mother vowed to shed the weight in time for the following festive season - and this year she will be rewarded for her efforts as she can host her own Christmas party as a svelte size 12. 'I looked like a Christmas pudding': Carol Bryant, right, said she was was horrified when she saw this picture of herself at a Christmas party last year . Slim: Carol has now dropped from 21 stone to 9 stone 10lbs and a trim size 12 after going on an extreme diet . She said: 'I was mortified when the photo went up on Facebook. l didn't even recognise myself at first, I looked like a Christmas pudding.' Determined to change her ways, in January 2013 she decided to try a meal replacement programme which limits your daily calorie intake to just 500 calories each day. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight,' she explained. Ian Marber, nutritionist says: 'The diets are monitored and so are considered safe for that reason. 'But very low calorie diets are not to be undertaken in the long term without supervision and also, importantly, clearance from your GP. 'It's what you eat after the diet has finished that's vital and I recommend seeing a nutrition professional afterwards to learn how to eat, not how to diet.' 'I was absolutely massive and I was terrified I would have a heart attack. 'Not to mention how awful I looked in photographs next to my slim friends. 'I was so jealous of all the fashionable clothes they got to wear, while I was stuck in frumpy t-shirts and baggy trousers.' After sticking to the plan for a . year, Carol has shed 12 stone and gone from a size 28 to a trim . size 12 in time for Christmas. 'This year there will be no hiding at Christmas parties for me,' said proud Carol. 'I've already picked out a gorgeous, shimmering size-12 dress to show off my trim, new figure. And I feel incredible.' Devastated by seeing herself in the photos Carol vowed to boycott Christmas parties until she lost the weight . Unsurprisingly, Carol's 5000 calorie-a-day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16, to a massive 21 stone and a size 28 . 'No role model': Carol quit her job working in an office to become a full-time mother to Lois, now six, pictured, but found herself spending a lot of time on the sofa . Carol had always struggled with her weight. When she was in her teens she was a size 16, then in 2007 after having her daughter Lois, now six, she piled on more pounds. This year she will be rewarded for her efforts and hosting her own Christmas party as a svelte size 12 . She quit her job working in an office to become a full-time mother, but would spend her days sat on the sofa gorging on greasy take-aways, fatty chocolates and salty crisps. Unsurprisingly, her 5000 calorie-a-day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16, to a massive 21 stone and a size 28. Carol says: 'It was disgusting how large I got, and I was no role model for my little girl. I was constantly hungry and would shovel platefuls of food down my throat without even thinking. It was an addiction.' But within the first two weeks of her diet, Carol had lost an incredible 24Ibs. 'The weight was just falling off of me,' she said. 'It was an amazing feeling and it spurned me on to lose more weight.' Carol also began walking every day so she now she weighs in at just 9st 10Ibs, dress size 12. Instead of having the meal replacements, she's now joined Slimming World so she can sustain her weightloss and said she's never felt more confident.

       "  'Sporting only the most stylish designer labels, wearing only meticulously matched colors, the Congo\\'s dandies are the very embodiment of sartorial elegance. Known as \"Sapeurs,\" these dapper dressers are a Congolese subculture devoted to the cult of style. In Brazzaville and Kinshasa -- the capitals of neighboring Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- they stand out among the widespread poverty, strutting the streets like walking works of art. \"It\\'s the fetishization of fashion -- they are the worshippers of fashion, it\\'s their god, it\\'s powerful,\" says Didier Gondola, author of \"History of the Congo,\" who has extensively researched the Sapeurs. But for the Sapeurs -- who are almost always men -- it\\'s not about what\\'s in vogue, it\\'s about style. The labels they covet most are those that evoke classic elegance. Suits by Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier and Armani are all in demand, as are Japanese labels Kenzo and Yamamoto, says Gondola. When it comes to shoes, exclusive French label Weston and British label Church\\'s reign supreme. And imitations will not be tolerated. \"You can lose your reputation if you are wearing imitation,\" says Gondola. \"That\\'s something blasphemous.\" See also: Desert festival: Oasis for sounds of the Sahara . But these labels don\\'t come cheap. Gondola, who was born in the Congo and teaches history at Indiana University in the United States, explains that Sapeurs aren\\'t rich; they typically work menial jobs, and have been known to resort to shoplifting to feed their addiction to apparel. In Brazzaville, it\\'s common for Sapeurs to rent or borrow clothes from fellow fops or requisition them from friends visiting from Europe. As the Congolese Diaspora has spread, so have the Sapeurs. They can now be found in European capitals including London, Brussels and Paris. Dixy Ndalla, 30, was born and raised in Brazzaville, but has lived in London since the age of 17. He\\'s infatuated with the classic cuts worn by the British aristocracy and can spend £1,000 a month on new shirts and jackets. \"I am very passionate about clothing, I\\'m passionate about colors and suits,\" he says. \"In the winter it\\'s anything to do with tweeds, in the summertime a nice blazer, a beautiful pair of jeans, a beautiful shirt. \"I especially love Hackett, one of the top designers in the UK ... Hackett suits start from around £600 and a bespoke made-to-measure will go out from £1,000 and upward.\" Ndalla travels back to Brazzaville in the summer and takes pride in showing off his very British attire. \"In the summer holidays, everyone goes to show their outfits,\" he says. \"They all meet in one street or bars and they all show their colors or the label of their suits ... it\\'s up to people to judge and appreciate who\\'s dressed well.\" Once dressed in their finery, Brazzaville\\'s Sapeurs will often head to \"Le Main Bleu,\" a favorite bar, where they have informal contests. Each tries to out Sap each other with their combination of style, comportment and designer labels -- known as \"griffes.\" But Ndalla doesn\\'t consider himself a Sapeur, because he doesn\\'t dress up to compete with others. For him, it\\'s simply about taking pride in what you wear. \"People from Congo love to dress up -- it\\'s something that\\'s in my blood,\" he says. Although every Sapeur has their own unique style, certain looks are especially popular. Pastel-colored three-piece suits are a staple of the Sapeurs\\' fastidiously assembled ensembles. They are finished off with a tie, cravat or bow tie -- and the obligatory pocket square protruding from their immaculately tailored jackets. Cigars and pipes -- lit or unlit -- are de rigueur. Italian photographer Daniele Tamagni stumbled across the Sapeurs when he travelled to Brazzaville in 2007. The next year he returned to photograph them, collecting his images in the book \"Gentlemen of Bacongo.\" He says individuals often belong to sub groups within the Sapeur culture, such as the Piccadilly group, who dress in Scottish kilts. \"One member has a sister in Scotland who brings him kilts,\" he explains. \"They use and they adapt to their taste and individuality. They are masters of style, they create their own style.\" See also: Congo\\'s erupting volcano boosts tourism . Some disapprove of the Sapeurs spending what little money they have on the frivolities of fashion. But Gondola argues that being a Sapeur isn\\'t just about vanity -- it\\'s a political statement. In the 1970s \"authenticity\" was part of the state ideology in the DRC -- a policy that prohibited the wearing of Western suits. The Sapeurs rebelled by wearing aggressively non-conformist clothes, including leather suits, says Gondola. To this day Kinshasa\\'s Sapeurs dress less conservatively than their suit-sporting Brazzaville brethren. \"The Sapeur is also about masculinity, politics, changing the stereotypes about how people view Africa,\" says Gondola. \"It\\'s about a lot of things, about beating the West at its own game, which is fashion: \\'You colonized us but we dress better than you.\\'\" Gondola says the history of the Sapeurs can be traced back to the 19th century, when the Republic of the Congo was a French colony. Some colonial masters would pay their servants in used clothes, and those servants would make a show of wearing their masters\\' clothes on Sundays. He adds that the phenomenon grew in the 1920s and 30s among Congolese nationals living in Paris -- in particular Sap pioneer and anti-colonial activist André Matswa. But it really took off after independence in 1960, when ordinary Congolese people would travel to Paris and return home wearing the latest fashions. In the 1970s, popular musician Papa Wemba, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), began promoting the idea of the Sapeur, forming the \"Société des Ambianceurs et Persons Élégants,\" or SAPE, of which many modern-day Sapeurs claim membership. So what is the enduring appeal of the Sapeur? \"It\\'s politics, spiritual, aesthetic, social -- so many things,\" says Gondola. \"It\\'s a whole science -- they are artists.\"',\n",

The spate of terrifying night-time rapes in an isolated, orthodox Christian community went on for four years and yet the victims could barely remember the ordeal and many believed they had dreamed it. It was not until 2009 that nine men were eventually convicted of the rape of more than 100 women and girls in their own homes in the Mennonite Manitoba Colony in Bolivia. But despite the convictions, it has emerged that the sexual attacks in the closed community are continuing. More than 100 women and girls were raped in the Mennonite Manitoba Colony in Bolivia but despite the convictions four years ago residents have admitted that the sexual assaults have continued (file picture) An investigation has uncovered that once more women and youngsters in the Old Colony, where motorised vehicles and electricity are banned, are suffering sexual assaults they can barely remember. Vice.com has found that many families believe the assaults are continuing despite the men, aged 19 to 43, being jailed. But members of the closed community told Vice . that without cameras or streetlights - both forbidden in the community - or a police force, they have no way to stop or catch the rapists. They say they will have to wait until someone is caught in the act and in the meantime increase security at their homes. One husband, whose wife was raped in the first spate of attacks, told Vice.com: 'It's definitely not as frequent. [The rapists] are being much more careful than before, but it still goes on.' From 2005 to 2009, women complained that they regularly woke up to intense pain and semen and blood on their sheets but their claims were not initially investigated and they were not believed. Some even reported waking up to find rope tied to their wrists or ankles or dirty fingerprints on their bodies but the victims could not remember the previous night. Many women had hazy memories or images of at least one man on top of them but they were not able to resist. Residents say they have heard repeated rumours that the night-time rapes have continued but because the closed community does not have a police force the alleged crimes are unlikely to be investigated (file picture) The Manitoba Colony in eastern Bolivia is home to about 3,000 people . The eventual trial found that the attackers used a powerful sedative to drug whole families before carrying out the rapes. Many . women were attacked as they lay next to their husbands, who were also . knocked unconscious by the narcotic. A girl of just three was among the victims and a woman of 60 years old. A pregnant woman gave birth at just six and a half months after being raped while unconscious. Young girls were taken to hospital the next morning suffering from terrible pain and bleeding. The gang of men, who had led some women to believe they were repeatedly attacked by demons, were eventually caught and jailed in 2009. Two of the men were found trying to break into a house and their story unraveled. Each of the nine-strong gang were jailed for 25 years and a vet who supplied the anaesthetic\\xa0 - made from a cow tranquilizer - was sentenced to 12 years. The colony - about 94 miles from Santa Cruz and home to about 3,000 ultraconservative Mennonites - has been deeply scarred by the scandal. Sara Guenter told Vice that she tried to stay awake and asked a trusted worker to guard the house but the attacks continued when no one was watching her home. She said: 'It happened so many times, I lost count.' Some residents initially believed the rape claims were concocted to hide affairs while others believed it was down to 'wild female imagination.' Electricity is banned in the Old . Colonies and the community lives off the land. Men and women's roles are . strictly segregated with men working as farmers and given extra education whereas . women only are responsible for cleaning and cooking. The community has no police force so no one investigated the claims until two men were finally caught trying to break into a neighbour's house. Before that there had been no investigation and the authorities were accused of turning a blind eye to the situation. Abraham Walls Enns, Manitoba Colony's civic leader told Vice: 'That's all behind us now. We'd rather forget than have it be at the forefront of our minds. 'We only knew that something strange was happening in the night. 'But we didn't know who was doing it, so how could we stop it?' Offers of help from outside of the colony, including from more liberal Mennonite communities in Canada and elsewhere, were rejected. Orders for psychological help for victims has also never materialised. Old Colony Mennonites do not use motorised vehicles or electricity . Mennonites are Christians that can be traced from Protestant groups on Europe. They follow the teachings of 16th Century priest Menno Simons, who gave the group his name. There are about 1.7million Mennonites in 82 countries, with prominent communities in Canada, the U.S., Ethiopia, India, and parts of south and central America including Bolivia, Mexico and Paraguay. Almost 400,000 Mennonites live in the U.S. with more than 220,000 living in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The vast majority of Bolivia's Mennonite population are ultraconservative. Over the centuries, members have been severely persecuted and partially due to their pacifism Mennonites fled to other lands where they were tolerated. In the Old Colonies, motorised vehicles, electricity, dance and sport are all banned. Old Order Mennonites tend to use horse and buggies for transportation and speak in a German dialect.\",\n",

       "  '(CNN) -- A judge Friday upheld a Cleveland, Ohio, jury\\'s recommendation that convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell be sentenced to death. Jurors convicted Sowell of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges, including abusing corpses and kidnapping. Wednesday, they recommended the death penalty. The convictions ended a saga that began in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims\\' remains inside Sowell\\'s home in Cleveland. He eventually was accused of killing at least 11 women ranging in age from 25 to 52. Cuyahoga County Judge Dick Ambrose imposed the sentence Friday morning. He could have overruled jurors and imposed a life sentence. Sowell, who pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, had his eyes closed during almost all of Friday\\'s hearing, CNN affiliates reported. He made no comment. Family members of the victims were allowed to make statements. \"Anthony, you will deal with a much higher power for the pain you have caused,\" said Donnita Carmichael, daughter of victim Tonia Carmichael. \"You are an animal and hell awaits your arrival.\" Sowell\\'s lawyers had asked for life in prison. Parole would not have been an option because Sowell, 51, is classified as a \"sexually violent predator.\" During the penalty phase of his trial, Sowell said he was \"sorry.\" \"I know that may not sound like much. But I truly am sorry from the bottom of my heart,\" he said. During his trial, Sowell maintained a candid banter with members of his defense team as he recounted claims of childhood abuse -- both physical and sexual. He grew up in East Cleveland, joined the Marines at age 18 and traveled to California, North Carolina and Japan, authorities said. Sowell served 15 years in prison for attempted rape before being released in 2005. People who met him after his release described him as \"a normal guy.\" He was known locally for selling scrap metal. Sowell\\'s inconspicuous two-story home sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant. A stench hovered around the area, but no one realized it was the scent of decaying human flesh, instead assuming it was a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. Many of Sowell\\'s victims struggled with drug addiction at some point, and court records showed many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits. The disappearances of the women -- many of whom lived near him -- went largely unnoticed for two years, with only four women being reported missing.',\n",

The . source, who Michelle regularly confides in, said: \\'Michelle comes from . a broken home and it has a lot to do with why she has found herself in . trouble again and again throughout her life. \\'Constantly, . she pushes boundaries and has been in trouble with the law, but really . all of it is because she is desperate to be loved. \\'Her mom and dad separated when she was a child and ever since Michelle has been yearning for some stability in her life. \\'Sadly after years of dating older women and men like Olivier Martinez, nothing seemed to work out for her. \\'But now Cara has come along, who is so much younger than the women she normally dates, but suddenly Michelle is happy again.\\' In . recent years, former Lost star Michelle, who openly admits she is bisexual, has endured a string of broken relationships after dating French heartthrob and S.W.A.T co-star Olivier Martinez, Fast and Furious co-star Vin Diesel as well as model Claudette Lali, director Francesca De Sola and . model Aleksandra Rastovic. The source claims Michelle had a \\'great thing\\' going with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken - who strongly hinted to Advocate magazine that she was in a relationship with her in 2006, yet Michelle has never confirmed their relationship. \\'Kristanna wanted to come out as a couple. She\\'s proud to be bisexual, but Michelle wasn\\'t ready to go public,\\' said the friend: \\'So instead of working it out, Michelle ended it. Smitten: Michelle was linked with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken, who hinted the couple were in a relationship in 2006 . Ex-lovers: Michelle Rodriguez iis said to have dated flimmaker Francesca de Sola. The pair are pictured at the screening of Francesca\\'s film 1%ers in New York in April 2013 . \\'Then she was left heartbroken a year later when she fell for another model/actress only to find out she had slept with someone else while she was away filming the movie Avatar.\\' The actress has also found herself behind bars after being in trouble repeatedly with the . law. In March 2002, she was . charged with assault and harassment when her girlfriend, Louise Ward, . claimed the tough girl had attacked her in their New Jersey apartment. Ward was left battered and bruised, but later dropped all charges against Michelle. The friend said: \\'Michelle can be intense and dive head first into . romances. This can land her in hot water as she found out with Louise. \\'Over the last 15-years there have been countless other examples of her disastrous love life.\\' Just one year later Michelle found herself in trouble again when she . appeared in court to face eight misdemeanor charges relating to two . driving incidents, including a DUI and a hit and run. In . 2004, she pleaded no contest to three of the charges, hit and run, . drunken driving and driving with a suspended license and went to jail . for 48 hours and was placed on probation for three years. And in 2005, while filming ABC hit Lost in Hawaii, the stunning brunette was fined multiple times for speeding. Later . that year on December 1st she was arrested for drunk driving, to which . she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine and spent five days in jail. Due . to this being a clear violation of her earlier drunk driving crimes, . she was also sentenced to 60 days in jail, but due to overcrowding was . released on the same day she entered. And it\\'s precisely this behavior that has left Cara\\'s family a little fearful. Michelle\\'s close friend admitted: \\'She\\'s a very free spirit and before this relationship she has always been terrified of commitment. “And because of her troubled past, many of them have essentially had to be her babysitter or a mother figure to her. \\'So now Cara might be younger than her, but she honestly thinks this is \\'the one\\'. Just before she met Cara she was talking about wanting a family within the next couple of years. Lovers? Michelle Rodriguez reportedly dated Vin Diesel, her Fast and Furious co-star. The pair pose at the premiere of Fast and Furious 6 in Seoul, South Korea, in May 2013 . Ex-love: Michelle Rodriguez was also said to have dated her S.W.A.T co-star Olivier Martinez. The actor is now married to Halle Berry . \\'She . really wants a baby and wants one soon and now she has found Cara she . thinks this could finally be the time to chase that dream. \\'Sadly due to Michelle’s troubled past, Cara’s family are not so sure.They are not 100 per cent pro this relationship and are in some ways willing it to end. \\'The 14-year age gap between the girls concerns them as does Michelle\\'s wayward reputation. \\'They . know Cara has been swept off her feet by Michelle, who has dropped . everything to be with her young love, but the family fear the . relationship will end in nothing but disaster. \\'I highly doubt at 21-years-old Cara is ready to start a family. She is no doubt currently smitten with Michelle, who dropped everything, including her girlfriend and friends, to be with her. \\'But . if anyone is going to get their heart broken in this relationship it\\'s . going to be Michelle. She will smother Cara, and wants to be around her . 24 hours a day.\\' The couple, who apparently met in . January, were also seen attending Prince\\'s secret gig at Ronnie Scott\\'s . club on Monday, February 17, and the Elle Style Awards the following . evening before heading to Milan to . close the autumn/winter fashion season. They then hired a private jet last week to head to Milan Fashion Week, where Cara had a busy schedule. The pair were spotted in coordinating black outfits while carrying bags as they made their way to their airplane - while the Brit beauty\\'s parents were also along for the trip. After landing in Milan, Michelle sat with her love as she sat in hair and makeup backstage at the Fendi autumn/winter 2014 fashion show. They then flew back to London and are now believed to be on vacation. Supportive: The Fast And Furious star hung out with her model squeeze backstage at Milan Fashion Week . Romantic getaway: It seems Michelle\\'s girlfriend Cara Delevingne might be on the Thailand holiday too as that same day she shared a photo of herself wearing scuba diving gear while in a tropical location . Sexy couple: Michelle\\'s post came days after Cara shared this snapshot . Michelle spoke openly about her sexuality in October after years of speculation, telling Entertainment Weekly, \\'I\\'ve never walked the carpet with anyone, so they wonder: What does she do with her vagina?\" Plus, I play a butchy girl all the time, so they assume I\\'m a lesbo.\\' Asked about the assumptions, she admitted: \\'Eh, they\\'re not too far off. I\\'ve gone both ways. I do as I please. I am too f--king curious to sit here and not try when I can. Men are intriguing. So are chicks.\\' This week, Michelle posted a picture of herself naked, revealing her bare derriere to the world as she appeared to be meditating. She was seen lapping up the sunshine in Thailand, where she is . currently enjoying a getaway, and the snapshot also showed a stunning . ocean view. And it is likely that the photo was taken by Cara, as that same day the model shared a picture of herself clad . in scuba diving gear in an equally tropical location. Michelle’s snap comes just days after her model squeeze shared her own extremely sexy picture on the social networking site. The source added: \\'You can see from the photos of them out together in London that they are clearly having fun. \\'They . don\\'t seem to have a care in the world and I know Michelle will pay for . everything, go everywhere with her and has unlimited funds to do as . they please. \\'To begin with . this will be nice and she will be flattered. But when she has to go . away to shoot a film, it will end and Michelle does fall hard. \\'And maybe it will all be a little too much for someone as young as Cara.\\' Turning heads: Michelle attended the BAFTAs in London earlier this month in a silk and leather plunging gown . Blossoming relationship: Michelle and Cara debuted their romance last month at a New York Knicks game .',\n",

Father-of-three David Richards from Canberra first won the title in 2011 with 331,038 lights, but was beaten by a family in New York who put up 346,283. His family vowed to take regain the title this Christmas - so installed more than 31 miles of wire with 502,165 lights, glowing reindeer and loud music around their suburban home, to the irritation of some neighbours. Scroll down for video . Blinding: Half a million Christmas lights have wowed and annoyed neighbours in equal measure in Canberra. Speaking about his achievement, father-of-three David Richards, who claimed a world record for the second time, said: 'I just love Christmas' Record: The lights are attached to every possible surface - including trees, hedges, walls and the roof . Glittering: The display at the family's home took more than a month to construct and will cost £1,400 to run . The sight has attracted neighbours from miles around - although not all of them are impressed. Some have not spoken to the family since 2011. Mr Richards, who lives in the suburb of Forrest with his wife Janean, son Aidan, . 13, and daughters Caitlin, ten, and Madelyn, six, insisted most neighbors supported . the display. He added: 'I have always loved . Christmas. Having the Christmas lights with the community coming in and . sharing it is a time when you get to know people you probably should . know better, I guess.' Guinness World Records today confirmed the family's charity feat has officially the most Christmas lights on a residential property. The twinkling bulbs will cost about £1,400 to run for a month - but the sum has been donated by a local power company. Celebration: David Richards, his wife Janean and daughter Madelyn raise a glass to celebrate his remarkable, but unusual achievement . Lit up: Scores of lights can be seen adoring the roof and nearby trees, much to the amazement of the people below . Quite the attraction! The stunt is open to the public - with scores of people already flooding to see the spectacle while many have viewed a video of the lights on YouTube . The stunt is open to the public, and hundreds of people have already visited and posted videos on Youtube. It will raise funds for children's charities including to fight Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Up to 70,000 people visited the light show when he last put it on in 2011 and it raised £44,000 for charity. This year Mr Richards wants to raise £56,000. He told the Canberra Times: 'It actually helps a lot of families who have put up with an amazing amount of grief. That makes it all worthwhile to me. 'It's like a party in your driveway every night.' Dedication: Mr Richards spent a whole month putting up the lights - which were independently verified by a Guinness World Record official . Happy times: As well as being record breakers, the lights will be used to illuminate the wedding of Mrs Richard's cousin on Saturday . The lights took a month to put up but Mr Richards did not have to count them all himself - instead delivery records and invoices were used to certify the total. And they have had an extra use, illuminating the wedding of his wife's cousin on Saturday. Mr Richards vowed he had retired after setting his 2011 record, but regained the taste for Christmas lights. Now he will not rule out defending himself against further challenges. However, he said he will need a generator if he puts up any more lights. Everybody needs good neighbours: Some nearby residents have not been on speaking terms with the Richards family since their previous record in 2011 . Dazzling: The wiring for the display is 31 miles long. If there were any more lights the family would need a generator to run it .\",\n",
       "  \"John Yates, 59, pictured outside court today, met\\xa0Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, online but their marriage  ended acrimoniously . An internet bride who made her fortune in the UK after marrying a British man she met online is now fighting her in the divorce courts for a 'fair share' of her wealth. Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, left Crimea for Leicester in 1999 after meeting John Yates through an international dating site and went on to earn more than he did. She had left for Britain for love and a better financial future because the average annual wage can be as low as £2,000-a-year at home. In her 12-years in the UK she has risen to a senior administrator at De Montfort University and amassed assets and cash. Now her truck-driving husband, who lives in a council house after they split two years ago, is taking her to court because he claims he deserves the 'fair share' of her wealth. Mrs Ivleva is living in their home in Leicester with her grown up son from a previous marriage, Robert, 26. Mr Yates says he is languishing with 'nothing' in council accommodation and insists he is due a 'fair share' of her money. The Court of Appeal heard that Mrs Ivleva told Mr Yates that she had divorced him in Ukraine, and this has sparked a bitter legal battle. She then tried to get her foreign divorce recognised in England in March but High Court judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson refused. He said that Mrs Ivleva had 'trailed her coat' by keeping her husband in the dark about details of the Ukrainian proceedings until it was too late for him to do anything about them. Describing their relationship as a 'limping marriage', he said 'basic fairness' to Mr Yates demanded that he be given the opportunity to divorce his wife in England. In his 'emphatic' ruling, the judge said that, although the divorce had been advertised in a Ukrainian newspaper, Mr Yates spoke very little of his wife's native language. In the latest legal skirmish Mrs Ivleva's son spoke on her behalf as she challenged the judge's decision at the Court of Appeal. Split: The couple, pictured together in 2005, broke up two years ago and Mrs\\xa0Ivleva has claimed that she already secured a divorce in Ukraine - but the British court won't accept it . She claimed to have suffered discrimination as a foreign wife and that the ruling amounted to an 'attack on the integrity' of the Ukrainian courts. However, sitting judge Lady Justice King sided with Mr Yates and described the judge's refusal to recognise her Ukrainian divorce as 'exemplary' and 'unimpeachable'. The ruling opened the way for Mr Yates to pursue his county court divorce petition and seek financial orders against his wife. He said outside court after the ruling: 'She's got everything. I've got nothing and I'm entitled to a fair share. 'I'm living in council accommodation from day-to-day. She can afford to go on holiday. I can't'. He added that he expected his decree nisi to go through on January 5, finally ending his marriage.\",\n",
       "  \"Whoopi Goldberg had her The View co-hosts all rallied against her during a discussion in which she supported a highly controversial discipline technique in the third episode of the revamped series Wednesday. With Nicolle Wallace, Rosie O'Donnell and Rosie Perez all shaking their heads in abject disapproval, Whoopi sided with a Michigan dad who recently forced his 4-year-old son to humiliate himself on a roadside with a sign that read 'I hit little girls.' 'That father took a great step and I'm proud of him,' Whoopi said of the man who could lose custody of his son for the stunt. Scroll down for video... Whose side are you on? Whoopi thinks a Michigan man who punished his 4-year-old by forcing him to hold up a humiliating sign was in the right . Rosie Perez was first to shun what\\xa0Rob Devine forced his son Tristan to do. 'He's a little kid,' the actress asserted, raising her signature voice for one of the first times since joining the show. 'He's 4-years-old, it's a little bit extreme.' Whoopi wouldn't back down, though, so former George W. Bush aide Nicolle Wallace put in her two-cents. 'I don't think you teach a kid a lesson by shaming,' said the communications maven. Then, as if to make amends for the rift that emerged between them on Tuesday, a miracle happened: resident fiery liberal Rosie O'Donnell agree with Wallace. 'Shame is never a way to teach a child anything' said O'Donnell, whose own special-needs son once grappled with a hitting problem before the family sought therapy. 'They're not\\xa0emotionally\\xa0ready to understand.' But even in an episode where the panel touched on the Adrian Peterson child abuse issue and selfies in the gynecologist's office, day three was a departure from day two when Wallace and O'Donnell shared some seriously tens . Disagreement: It was Whoopi's turn to anger the group on Wednesday as she sided with a father with some controversial thoughts on displinine . Whoopi agreed: The creative punishment used by Rob Devine (right) when he discovered his son Tristan had been harassing female classmates became a source of a classic The View clash. Nicolle and both Rosies said 4-year-old is too young to humiliate a child . The once-booted co-host compared a characterization Wallace made of Obama's lack of warmth with the 'international incident' that came when rapper Kanye West publicly declared that Bush's response (or lack thereof) to the Katrina disaster meant he hated black people. 'He revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement,' Wallace said of her then boss, who wrote of his dismay over West's assertion in his 2010 memoir Decision Points. She then called O'Donnell's words 'an attack.' O'Donnell snatched the opportunity to turn Wallace's words against her. 'He was very upset in the plane as he flew over Katrina,' quipped the comedienne. 'It was a very long time before he showed up. That is a fact, not an attack.' Wallace, who just the day before admitted on the show that she had nothing to do with Bush's decision not to visit Katrina--but simply fly over it--was forced to agree. Ironically, on the season's same inaugural episode, O'Donnell made sure to say of Wallace: 'I like her, I swear!' Whether that's true or not, the hot and cold chemistry appears to have worked, at least for the time being. The season 15 premier on Monday won the show its highest ratings in eight years. According to The Wrap, it's the second most watched premier ever for the daytime series. More to come? Republican Nicolle Wallace and liberal Rosie O'Donnell traded some harsh words during a very tense moment on just the second episode of The View's new lineup .\",\n",
       "  \"One of the most fascinating aspects of Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography for the public must be the revealing of all the frailties and insecurities professional sportsmen feel in the dressing room. It’s certainly not as harmonious or lovey-dovey as people might presume. Players are always getting on each other’s nerves or having issues to resolve. You hear professional footballers whingeing if they are away for longer than a couple of weeks at a World Cup but international cricketers are away from home for months on end and see more of their team-mates than their families. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pietersen say a good coach would have managed the situation . Kevin Pietersen has lifted the lid on all the frailties and insecurities in the dressing room . There will always be tensions, particularly when you consider the highly-pressurised environment they work in and that every move they make is scrutinised and analysed. The Manchester United footballers Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didn’t get on and in my England team Darren Gough and Andy Caddick had their moments, but that doesn’t really matter. As I said in these pages the other day, Michael Holding will tell you that some members of the great West Indies side didn’t get on. Shane Warne will say the same about his Australian team. But once they stepped on that field they respected each other and did everything in their power to win the game for their team. I liken it to sitting an examination every day of the week, and we all know how nervous and tetchy our kids can be the day before an exam. It is why there will always be niggles between team-mates and why they won’t always get on. Team-mates Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didn't get on at Manchester United . I’ve heard about the accusation of cliques in the England dressing room but that has always been the case and always will be. There will always be groups of three or four players who prefer to spend time with each other. When you are away for three months, you can’t expect everyone to go out together every night. You have to treat players like adults and in return they must have respect for one another even if they are not mates. There was plenty of banter and mickey-taking in the England dressing room when I played but someone like Marcus Trescothick, perhaps because he was teased about his weight when he was young, was always good at reminding anyone to be careful about not crossing the line. Rarely would we have a go at each other about cricketing mistakes because it was all so important but Mike Atherton, for one, would always remind me if I got out to a bad shot. It was just that he would wait a few days before doing so. Darren Gough (left) and Andy Caddick had their moments when Nasser Hussain was England captain . That is not bullying to me and I can honestly say I have never considered any cross words or mickey-taking in any England team I have played in — or watched — to be bullying. Yes, the England team is a tough school but if you can’t cope with a few tough words from your team-mates how are you going to cope with Mitchell Johnson and Brad Haddin? But I do agree with some of what Pietersen has said. I have long disagreed with how often the England bowlers would have a go at anyone who misfielded or dropped a catch and I was amazed at how long that was allowed to continue. Apart from anything else it plays into the hands of the opposition. They will look at that and say: ‘We’ve got this lot on the run. They are at each other.’ It just wasn’t a good look and I’m glad that there seems less of that sort of thing now. Nasser Hussain tried to embrace\\xa0‘difficult characters' like\\xa0Phil Tufnell when he was England captain . And if it is true that people had to stand up in front of the group and apologise when they made a mistake then England should be careful. That really is school yard stuff. The flip side is that you want your team to be challenged and pushed to make sure they perform to the best of their ability, and it is not always the captain or the coach who does the challenging. For me, it would hit a lot harder if one of my team-mates, rather than the coach or captain, had a word with me after something and said: ‘Come on Nas, you can do better than that.’ Clearly, this England team pushed each other hard and it seems Pietersen didn’t like to be treated in that way. It does seem that England may have had a tendency to overdo the methods that took them to three Ashes triumphs and No 1 in the world Test rankings. The admonishing of players in the field is one example. Another is their reliance on statistics when, at times, they should have trusted their cricketing instinct more. When I was captain I would try to embrace the so-called ‘difficult characters’ and do everything to concentrate on what they could do rather than what they couldn’t. If people like Phil Tufnell, Caddick and Graham Thorpe could take wickets and score runs for us then they were fine by me. Andy Flower (right) tried to keep KP onside so England would benefit from his considerable talent . You have to treat everyone differently. Pietersen and Alastair Cook have almost identical career records and are two of the best batsmen England have ever had, but as human beings they could not be more different and have to be treated as such. The key with KP, clearly, was trying to keep him happy and make him feel loved. But coach Andy Flower will tell you he did that for five years, he treated Pietersen differently and did everything to manage him and get him onside so England would benefit from the match-winning innings of which he was capable. It’s all very well people saying Kevin was easy to manage when he first came into the side but he would have been wouldn’t he? He was a young player finding his way and there’s no way he would have challenged anyone senior. Pietersen's lucrative contract with\\xa0Indian Premier League had repercussions\\xa0for England team . Where everything clearly changed is with the advent of the Indian Premier League. It seemed to make Pietersen believe he was bigger than the team, and perhaps other players became jealous of the money he was making. The dynamic of one of the most successful of all England teams clearly changed. Flower had tired of repeatedly trying to manage Pietersen. When results started going against England and their star batsman was not quite looking like the player he once was, England decided enough was enough. As I have said, there are some valid points here but nearly everyone who has tried to manage him has found him incredibly hard work. Everybody can’t be wrong. So maybe one day Kevin Pietersen might take a look at himself rather than blaming everyone else for the way he has been treated by England. He might have to look back and say: ‘Was it me?’\",\n",

       "  \"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Soviet spies have admitted using bugging devices on the Royal Family and former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Secret agents from the KGB targeted Princess Margaret in the 1960s, attaching listening aids to her lighter, cigarette case, ashtrays and telephones. According to the Sunday Express, they homed in on the Princess during a trip to Copenhagen, Denmark in 1964. Lord Snowdon And Princess Margaret get ready to board a plane in September 1964 ahead of their visit to Copenhagen. Russian spies have admitted bugging the Princess on the trip . Until now, Russia has always denied the covert operation, which took place in a hotel, but has now admitted compiling a dossier on the Princess's love affair with Robin Douglas-Home and further relationships with Roddy Llewellyn, Colin Tennant and Dominic Ewes, a painter who later committed suicide. Spies passed photos, tape recordings and 'most interesting, even scandalous' gossip involving senior royal figures. It is also said agents tried to get information from Margaret's therapist, Kay Kiernan, who also treated the Queen. Intelligence on Prince Phillip was gathered via society osteopath and artist Stephen Ward, who later killed himself at the height of the Profumo affair. But spies failed in a sting operation on then future leader Harold Wilson, setting up a 'honey trap' for him in a Moscow hotel. Princess Margaret (second from right and then left) was targeted by KGB spies on her visit to Copenhagen in 1964. Bugging devices were planted in her lighter, cigarette case, ashtrays and telephones . A new book will detail the KGB spies' attempts at bugging the Royal Family. Pictured, the Kremlin, in Moscow . Female agents posing as prostitutes patrolled the hotel overlooking the Kremlin, with a camera planted in a chandelier in his bedroom. But when the film was developed, Wilson's face was disguised. Colonel Vadim Goncharov, who has since died, was the KGB chief in charge of the snooping operations, and he was ordered by bosses to go on television to deny the claims, fearing they would cast a shadow over the Queen's first and only visit to Russia in 1994. But last week Russia newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda boasted that among Goncharov's successes was 'the bugging of drunken parties of the British Princess Margaret'. A book published next year, Entitled The Kremlin v The Windsors, by the paper's intelligence analyst Gennady Sokolov will provide further details of the operation, according to the paper. Master spy Goncharov, who staged stings in more than 100 countries and survived assassination attempts, said of the Princess Margaret operation: 'As I recall there were no lovers, though there was a visitor. 'On this occasion our interest was in getting confidential information which would open certain doors for us in Britain.' On the failed attempt at trapping Wilson, he said: 'It was if he was playing games with us.'\",\n",
       "  'County Kildare, Ireland (CNN) -- The mayor of a town in Ireland has resigned and faces a possible police investigation after saying he would no longer represent people of black African origin. Councillor Darren Scully was Mayor of Naas in County Kildare, near the Irish capital, Dublin. Interviewed on local radio Tuesday morning, Scully said he had decided not to represent black Africans because of their \"aggressive\" attitude to him. \"I have been met with aggressiveness, I have been met with bad manners,\" he claimed. \"I have also been played the race card - it\\'s been said \\'Oh yeah, you will help white people, but you don\\'t help black people\\'.\" The then mayor continued: \"After a while I made a decision that I was just not going to take on representations from black Africans, that I would be very courteous to them and I would pass on their query to other public representatives who would take their concerns.\" Members of other political parties called for Scully to resign and Tuesday evening he did just that. He issued the following statement: \"I wish to apologise unreservedly for my remarks on 4FM and KFM. I realise they have caused deep hurt and offence in all communities and in all sectors of society. \"I have been proud to be Mayor of Naas and to represent all the people of the town. However, as a result of the upset that I have caused, I feel it is appropriate that I step down from this position.\" Earlier, political rivals Sinn Fein had accused him of being racist, but in his statement Scully denied the claim. He said: \"I realise now that my remarks were open to an interpretation that I did not intend. I abhor racism in all its forms.\" Naas Town Council had called a special meeting for Tuesday evening to discuss the controversy, but Scully resigned just ahead of it. The now ex-mayor is a member of the main party in the Irish coalition government - Fine Gael - but said he was expressing personal views. The party agreed - Fine Gael issued this statement: \"The views expressed by Cllr Scully do not reflect the views of Fine Gael and they are not party policy. \"Fine Gael is an inclusive party and we are trying to build a country that caters for all.\" A lawmaker with the junior partners in the coalition government, Aodhan O Riordain of the Labour Party, said he had reported the matter to Irish police with a view to prosecution. O Riordain branded Scully\\'s comments \"outrageous\" and said they could be considered as incitement to hatred. The Irish census of 2006 showed there were 1,862 people of African origin living in Kildare out of a population in the county of 186,335, according to the Central Statistics Office in Dublin. Naas has a total population of just over 20,000. Local people told CNN Tuesday that race relations in the town are good and they were \"really surprised\" a local representative would make such comments.',\n",

The revolutionary leader attended the inauguration of an art gallery in Havana run by Cuban artist Alexis Leyva, aka Kcho, yesterday. It is the first time Castro has been seen in public since attending a National Assembly meeting in February 2013. Public appearance: Fidel Castro, Cuba's former President and revolutionary leader, looks at the camera during a rare public appearance to attend the inauguration of an art gallery in Havana, Cuba . Support: Castro is helped into the gallery by an aide and a metal walking stick . Castro, who ceded power to his brother Raul Castro in 2008 after falling ill in 2006, has kept a low profile in recent years. But his silence in the wake of Nelson Mandela's death prompted widespread speculation that his health is ailing. The former South African president was a close ally, thanks to Cuba's backing of Angolan fighters who battled forces supported by the previous pro-apartheid South African government of the 1980s. This prompted the release of pictures in December of Castro meeting with a Spanish reporter about current events for more than two hours earlier that month. Recluse: The appearance is the first time Castro has been seen in public since attending a National Assembly meeting in February 2013 . Speculation: Castro's low profile prompted fears about the state of his health . The photo shows Castro, 87, seated and wearing a blue sweatsuit, looking intensely at writer Ignacio Ramonet and gesturing with his left hand. Mr Ramonet and the website Cubadebate say the photo was taken early December. The reporter told the AP that he and Castro discussed a wide range of topics including Mandela, Venezuelan politics and climate change. 'I found him to be in excellent health and in a good mood, physically, mentally and psychologically,' Mr Ramonet said. Castro left power after 47 years after suffering serious intestinal bleeding in 2006, handing his duties to his brother Raul. Castro looks closely at an art piece during a rare public appearance to attend the inauguration of an art gallery run by Cuban artist Alexis Leyva, aka Kcho . Poor health: Castro left power after 47 years after suffering serious intestinal bleeding in 2006 . While Fidel Castro has been out of the spotlight due to his health, his brother Raul has been making enough headlines for them both as he caused a stir after shaking President Obama's hand during the public memorial ceremony for Mandela in South Africa. It then emerged that representatives from the two historically antagonistic nations had already been in talks for six months. During the president's trip back from South Africa, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters on Air Force One that 'it's been quite some time since the Presidents of the United States and Cuba were even in the same place.' But he acknowledged that 'we’re in talks on issues associated with migration that, again, I think allow for there to be greater connectivity particularly among Cuban Americans and Cuba.' Castro ceded power to his brother Raul Castro in 2008 and has kept a low profile ever since . Official pictures have been released of Castro in recent months to quell the mounting speculation over his health .\",\n",
       "  'Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro lashed out at U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday for demanding changes on the island in order to improve bilateral relations and referred to him as \"stupid.\" On Wednesday, Obama told Hispanic journalists that he would be willing to change the country\\'s tough line on Cuba \"when we start seeing a serious intention on the part of the Cuban government to provide liberty for its people.\" On Thursday, Castro responded with sarcasm in a written essay published in Cuban state media. \"How nice! How intelligent! So much generosity has failed to let him understand that after 50 years of blockade and crimes against our country, they haven\\'t been able to bow our people.\" He went on to say many things would change in Cuba, but only thanks to Cubans\\' own efforts and \"despite\" the United States. \"Perhaps that empire will collapse first,\" he added. He also slammed a recent ruling by a U.S. judge against a Cuban agent, but he said it was to be expected. \"Otherwise, the empire would cease to be the empire and Obama would cease to be stupid.\"',\n",
       "  \"A devastated son whose father was beheaded and his mother abducted a week ago today said he now hopes she is dead to ‘ease her suffering’ as it is too unbearable to think of her in pain. Retired Russell Dermond’s decapitated body was found at his exclusive, lake-front home last Tuesday, but his wife of 62 years Shirley has vanished, in a suspected kidnapping. Investigators in Putnam County, Georgia are completely baffled by the gruesome crime and no one can understand why anyone would want to harm the beloved elderly couple. Nothing was taken from their $1m home, their car keys and cellphones were left behind. Scroll down for video . Unspeakable: Shirley Dermond, 87, has not been seen for more than a week after her husband's decapitated body was found at their home. Their son, Keith, said: 'If she is still alive, we can’t imagine . what she is going through… but it . has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father, just . to ease her suffering' Mystery: No-one has been able to think of why anyone would want to harm Shirley and Russell. Nothing was taken, their cellphones and car keys were left behind. Police have ruled out a mob hit and that Russell was in witness protection. And their family they can't believe it is linked to the drug murder of son, Mark, in 2000 . The police have been forced to deny they were taken out in a mob hit and their despairing family have also denied their is any link between the horror and the killing of one of the couple's son's in a drug deal gone wrong. Officers have been dredging a nearby lake and searching woods for clues, but as yet the local Sheriff says they have no leads. They still haven’t found 88-year-old Mr Dermond’s severed head. One of the Dermond’s three heartbroken children, Keith said the family had been wracking their brains to try to come up with any possible motive, but they say their parents didn’t have a single enemy in the world. He is still desperate for the safe return of his 87-year-old mother, but the idea of her suffering at the hands of a, ‘sick’ murderer is just too much for him to bear. Speaking to MailOnline, Keith, 55, from Jacksonville, Florida, said: ‘We are completely devastated, but our primary focus is finding our mother. The thought of her suffering is just unbearable. ‘Each hour that goes by, my brother, my sister and me are becoming more resigned to the fact that we may never see her again and we may never know what happened. ‘If she is still alive, we can’t imagine what she is going through. The human spirit is incredibly strong… but it has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father, just to ease her suffering. ‘Whoever did this was so sick in the head that I just can’t imagine it.’ Sick: Keith, pictured center left with wife Kathleen and other family members, said: 'The more we think about it, the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them.' He added it could have been the work of a cult . Russell Dermond was last seen May 1 at a supermarket not far from his home in the gated Reynolds Plantation east of Atlanta. Shirley Dermond had started the next day’s newspaper crossword puzzle, but no one had taken the couple’s May 3 mail out of their mailbox.\\xa0 That same day, last Saturday, the Dermonds failed to show up at a friend’s Kentucky Derby party. According to Putnam County Sheriff, Howard Sills, financial and phone records have not turned up anything to suggest the Dermonds would be the target of criminal activity. Since the murder speculation about a potential motive has been rife. Sheriff Sills has been forced to deny rumors that Mr Dermond – whose body was found in his garage - was in a witness protection program and may have been killed by mobsters. He has also said there is no evidence that the brutal crime was in some way linked to the murder of the couple’s son Mark in a drug deal gone wrong in 2000. Mark was gunned down in Atlanta as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine on his birthday. Troy Major was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. He was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. He has tried to appeal twice, but both attempts were denied. And Keith says that while his brother Brad, his sister Leslie and him have considered a possible link between their brother’s slaying and their father’s murder, It just doesn’t make sense. Isolated: Keith reckons they may have been targeted not because of their wealth - as they have richer neighbors either side, but because they live at the end of a cul-de-sac with no other houses that close . Discovery: Officers dredge a lake during the search for Shirley Dermond. Her body was found by a fisherman . He said: ‘People have tried to link this to my brother’s murder. We have obviously thought about that, because it is a violent connection to my parents, but that doesn’t make sense either. ‘The individual is still in jail and anyway, my parents weren’t really involved in the case at the time. They didn’t attend court, so if this was some kind of revenge, they would not be obvious targets. ‘It is a complete mystery as far as we are concerned. We have been wracking our brains trying to think of anyone who may have wanted to do this, but we have no idea. ‘My father hadn’t been in business for 20 years. He just spent his time relaxing and playing golf. He just didn’t have any enemies. ‘The more we think about it, the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them. ‘My parents live at the end of a cul-de-sac, so they have no neighbors either side. Maybe that’s why they were targeted? ‘It could have been anything, something to do with a cult, we just don’t know. There were definitely people in that neighborhood who would be more obvious targets if it was a robbery. My parents were comfortable, but they definitely weren’t wealthy.’ Keith and his siblings initially flew to Georgia to try to help with the investigation, but they have not been allowed in the house - where many happy family parties were held over the years - because it is still a crime scene. Now they have returned home where they are playing an unbearable waiting game, desperately hoping for news about their mother one way or the other. And heartbreakingly, Sheriff Howard Sills has said he is not optimistic she’ll be found alive. Speaking on Tuesday, he said: ‘I’m running down one thing after another and coming up empty.’ There was speculation that an elderly woman who turned up dazed and confused Monday at a Tampa hospital was Shirley Dermond, but that has been completely dismissed. Concern: The alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a Kentucky Derby party . And Sills said rumors of organized crime involvement are unfounded. He said: ‘No, the man wasn’t in witness protection. He wasn’t going to testify. There’s no evidence of any kind of torture.’ On Tuesday, they enlisted the aid of a Department of Natural Resources submarine robot to scour the deep peninsula off Lake Oconee outside the couple’s home. So far, they’ve turned up nothing. Sills said he had also dispatched deputies to a wooded area near the crime scene in the hope they would discover some kind of clue. Keith – who like his late father, manages a chain of restaurants - said: ‘The Sheriff is keeping us informed as much as he can. I spoke to him yesterday. He is holding back some information as it is important to the case. ‘The house is still a crime scene, they are looking for finger prints and dredging the lake, but there just doesn’t seem to be much in terms of leads.’ He added: ‘My parents were married for 62 years. Family was everything to them. Their happiest times were spent with us, that’s what they loved doing. We just pray someone who knows something comes forward and puts an end to all of this.’\",\n",

       "  '(CNN) -- What do you do when you\\'re NASA and comedian Stephen Colbert wins your contest to name the new wing for the International Space Station? You name an orbital exercise machine after him. NASA will name an orbital exercise machine after comedian Stephen Colbert. The Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill, or COLBERT, is expected to keep astronauts in shape. With the help of a legion of fans, Colbert got the most votes in the space agency\\'s online poll soliciting names for Node 3, which will be called Tranquility after the Sea of Tranquility, where Apollo 11 landed on the moon. Astronaut Sunita \"Suni\" Williams revealed NASA\\'s decision on \"The Colbert Report,\" which aired on Comedy Central on Tuesday. \"Your name will be in space, in a very important place,\" Williams said as Colbert reacted in mock disgust to her announcement of the node\\'s new name. \"I think a treadmill is better than a node ... because the node is just a box for the treadmill,\" Colbert deadpanned. \"Nobody says, \\'Hey, my mom bought me a Nike box.\\' They want the shoes that are inside.\" Colbert\\'s campaign generated welcome attention for the oft-forgotten International Space Station, but it also presented a dilemma for NASA. The contest rules spelled out that NASA reserves the right to \"ultimately select a name in accordance with the best interests of the agency. ... Such name may not necessarily be one which is on the list of voted-on candidate names.\" The runner-up name to Colbert was Serenity, which was more in line with the names of the other nodes. Harmony, the name given Node 2, was chosen by a poll of kindergartners in 2007. The publicity caused by Colbert\\'s interest in Node 3 turned out well for the space agency. \"This spread overall awareness of the International Space Station,\" said Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA\\'s associate administrator for Space Operations, who has appeared on Colbert\\'s show. NASA changed its plan to announce the new name at the end of April at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida when Colbert\\'s producers invited them to do it on their show, the space agency said. Pennsylvania Congressman Chaka Fattah, who stepped in the naming fray in March, when he said Colbert had won the naming contest fair and square, called the decision a good compromise. It\\'s \"one small step for NASA and a giant step for the Colbert nation,\" the congressman said, playing off Neil Armstrong\\'s line when he first set foot on the moon in 1969. Colbert\\'s loyal fans have, in the past, bombarded polls to have things named after him. In 2006, Colbert out-polled every other name in a bridge-naming contest in Hungary. The country\\'s government later said it cannot name the bridge after the comedian because he does not speak Hungarian and is not dead. Colbert also tried to get himself on Democratic and Republican primary ballots in his home state of South Carolina in 2007. The Democratic Party\\'s executive council voted against his inclusion, and he did not qualify for the Republican primary because he missed the deadline. However, ice cream maker Ben and Jerry named a new flavor in honor of him, calling it Colbert\\'s AmeriCone Dream. Virgin America also named one of its planes Air Colbert.

       "  '(CNN) -- Issac is expected to move over Arkansas on Friday and over southern Missouri Friday night after lingering over the Louisiana area dumping heavy rains for days. After making landfall on Tuesday night as a powerful Category 1 hurricane, Issac has weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm than a tropical depression. It came virtually on the same day, seven years after Katrina devastated Louisiana and for some Issac felt too much like the deadly hurricane that is blamed for the deaths of 1,800 people. \"This is unbelievable. Deja vu, man,\" said Billy Nungesser, the president of Plaquemines Parish, Thursday as he surveyed the hard-hit town of Ironton that was inundated by floodwaters and sludge. \"There is more water here than Katrina.\" But for the many that braced for the worse and were spared, Friday is a day to breath a sigh of relief and to continue to clean up the mess Issac left behind. State government offices in at least 13 parishes would remained closed Friday because of flooding and most others would reopen, CNN affiliate WBRZ reported. Emergency crews were also trying to restore power to many. More than 827,000 customers -- down from 915,000 earlier in the day -- had no electricity across Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, utility companies reported Thursday. One company, Coast Electric Power, reduced a high of 30,000 outages to 8,000 by Thursday evening . The bodies of a man and woman were found in 7 feet of water at a home in Plaquemines Parish, officials said late Thursday. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of the death of the couple, described as being their 40s, Nungesser told CNN. The two were found late Thursday afternoon in the home\\'s kitchen. The house is on the parish\\'s East Bank, said Commander Terry Rutherford of the Plaquemines Parish Sheriff\\'s Office. Officials also intentionally breached a levee in Plaquemines Parish, southeast of New Orleans. The move was needed to help drain floodwaters in the Braithwaite and Scarsdale communities. In Tangipahoa, Parish President Gordon Burgess called for a mandatory evacuation for those living within a half mile of the Tangipahoa River. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the move was a precaution because if the dam were to break it would only take 90 minutes for floodwaters to get to Kentwood, a town of about 2,200 residents. Later Thursday, Burgess said he did not know how many people had been evacuated along the 54-mile stretch of the river. Kentwood saw 75 people move. \"I\\'m feeling much more comfortable tonight and I\\'m going to sleep better tonight,\" Burgess said. The storm has had a \"major impact\" on Mississippi, Gov. Phil Bryant said in Gulfport said Thursday. Also officials in Mississippi earlier reported a storm-related death. A tow truck driver attempting to clear debris on a road was struck and killed by a falling tree, officials said. The incident took place at midnight, said Amanda Harris, deputy director of the Pearl River County Emergency Management office. The National Weather Service said it received reports of the fatality in Picayune. An earthen dam on 700-acre Lake Tangipahoa in Mississippi was holding its own and not leaking late Thursday, despite significant damage, according to the Pike County Emergency Management Agency. Agency director Richard Coghlan said a \"controlled breach\" or spillway will be created at the Percy Quin State Park lake to relieve pressure and drain it. Crews were working carefully overnight, moving in equipment to prepare for the operation expected to commence later Friday once water levels drop a bit. \"They don\\'t want to influence the level of the river any more than they have to.\" Residents of 19 houses and seven mobile homes, along with three businesses, below the lake were asked to evacuate. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency does not expect a catastrophic event, said spokesman Greg Flynn. Coghlan agreed with that assessment. Water levels in most affected areas will gradually subside Friday, the hurricane center said, concluding its reports on Isaac. Isaac moved into southern Arkansas Thursday afternoon, bringing with it the possibility of flash flooding and tornadoes. \"It\\'s looking more disorganized but it is still putting out quite a bit of rain,\" said National Weather Service meteorologist Charles Dalton in Little Rock. Rainfall around Little Rock could total 5 inches by Friday, said Dalton. Higher numbers were expected in the southeastern portion of Arkansas. CNN\\'s Brian Todd contributed to this report.',\n",

       "  \"This is the face belonging to an ancient skeleton buried in Roman times, created using the latest 3D reconstruction technology. The so-called 'Beachy Head Lady' - because she was discovered in the East Sussex beauty spot - had her face recreated using craniofacial reconstruction techniques. Her skeleton was first discovered in Beachy Head 1953, and she is thought to have lived around 245 AD- the middle of the Roman period in Britain. Unusually Beachy Head Lady is from sub-Saharan Africa which was outside of the Roman Empire. This is the face of an ancient skeleton buried in Roman times, created using 3D reconstruction techniques . Experts are not entirely sure how she ended up in Britain, but researchers believe Beachy Head Lady probably grew up in the area and was possibly the wife or mistress of a local official at a nearby Roman villa. Another theory is that she was a merchant trading wares in Europe and chose to settle in the country. Jo Seaman, heritage officer at Eastbourne Borough Council, said: ‘This is a fantastic discovery for the south coast. ‘We know this lady was around 30 years old, grew up in the vicinity of what is now East Sussex, ate a good diet of fish and vegetables, her bones were without disease and her teeth were in good condition. Researchers used the size of the skull and traces of where the muscle would have met the bone to build up a picture of Beachy Head Lady's appearance . The female's skeleton suggests that the woman was around 30 years old when she died in 245AD. Experts believe she grew up in Sussex despite being from Sub-Saharan Africa. This is especially interesting as this area was beyond the reaches of the Roman Empire. Because she was not found with any grave goods, archaeologists are unable to deduce what social status she was. It is however possible that she was the wife or mistress of an official. She may also have been a merchant traveller too. ‘Without the context of seeing the burial site or grave goods, we don’t yet know why she was here, or her social status. ‘However based on what we know of the Roman era and a similar discovery in York, it’s possible she was the wife of a local official or mistress of the extensive Roman villa which is known to be close to Eastbourne Pier, or she may have been a Merchant, plying the trade routes around the Mediterranean up to this remote European outpost.’ Mr Seaman said that isotopes showed the Beachy Head Lady was raised in or around Eastbourne from a young age. He said the skeleton was in good condition with no signs of hard labour. Eastbourne museums paired up with the University of Dundee to use Radio-Isotope Analysis to examine bones and teeth for trace elements absorbed from food and water during an individual’s lifetime, giving a geological fingerprint to the region in which they grew up. Her full skeleton is on show for the first time to the public at Eastbourne Borough Council’s museum service which was awarded a grant of £72,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Beachy Head Lady's full skeleton is on show for the first time to the public at Eastbourne Borough Council's museum service which was awarded a grant of £72,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund . Beachy Head is a chalk headland in Southern England, close to the town of Eastbourne . The skeleton makes up part of the Eastbourne Ancestors project at the museum. The aim was to identify the gender and age of each skeleton in its collection to build up stories about them. Testing of the bones and teeth has identified the national or regional origins, age, gender, state of health, diet, and in some cases, how they died. The researchers were also able to use the size of the skull and traces of where the muscle . would have met the bone to build up a picture of her appearance. Most of the skeletons are Anglo-Saxon, from about 1,500 years ago, but some are Neolithic and more than 4,000 years old. Eastbourne Borough Council Cabinet Member for Tourism and Leisure, Cllr Carolyn Heaps said: ‘It is very exciting to open the first local history related exhibition in ten years. ‘The exhibition is focused on telling the stories of those that date back to Prehistory, giving an insight into what they may have worked as, what cultures they may have adopted as well as their age and gender.’ The skeleton was first discovered in Beachy Head (pictured) in 1953, and she is thought to have lived around AD245 - the middle of the Roman period in Britain .\",\n",
       "  \"Tartan terrorist: An undated picture of Scottish separatist Adam Busby who has been charged with emailing a series of bomb threats to Pittsburgh University . The founding member of a Scottish terror group has been charged with emailing 17 bomb threats to the University of Pittsburgh which caused widespread panic and forced the evacuation of more than 100 buildings. Adam Stuart Busby, 64, currently in custody in Dublin, Ireland, allegedly sent a series of threats to the school between April 6 and 21, and sent similar emails to federal courthouses in Pittsburgh, Erie and Johnstown in June. Busby is also charged with threatening Pittsburgh-based U.S. Attorney David Hickton - who led the investigation that resulted in Busby's indictment - in a June 20 email. A prolific hoaxer, Busby was convicted in Ireland in 2010 for sending a series of emails claiming . that there were explosive devices on flights between London's Heathrow . Airport and New York City. He was sentenced to four years in . prison but was released early this year and allegedly sent the Pitt . threats before he was returned to prison last month. It is not clear when he will be brought to Pittsburgh to face the new charges. Curiously Busby has no known ties to Pittsburgh or the university, and Mr Hickton wouldn't comment on why he allegedly sent the threats or whether they're related to his activities with the Scottish National Liberation Army, an outlawed militant group that seeks Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. Busby is now charged with threatening to poison some English water supplies and then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2010, along with some bomb hoaxes he allegedly called in to hotels and the media. He suffers from multiple sclerosis and appeared in a wheelchair before the High Court in Dublin last month. The university began receiving bomb threats written on bathroom stalls in mid-February, for which nobody has yet been charged. Investigators don't believe those threats are tied to Busby, who allegedly sent his emails to capitalize on the momentum from the earlier threats. The university was eventually the target of more than 40 emailed threats - some sent to the school, and others to local journalists who alerted authorities - all of which are attributed to Busby, though he's charged with sending only 17 of them. Hickton said the investigation involved complex efforts to trace the emails through overseas computer servers. Typically, federal authorities in wire fraud cases file charges for only a representative sampling of counts for which they have the most evidence. In all, the university received 52 threats against 160 buildings that prompted 136 evacuations, Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said Wednesday. Students wait on the street after being evacuated from the University of Pittsburgh after a bomb threat was received in April . Prosecutors also announced new charges . against two Ohio men, including one previously charged in June, for some . YouTube threats that claimed university computers had been hacked. Those threats are not directly related to the bomb scares, but were . uncovered as a result of the same investigation . Some emailed threats claimed to be sent by a group calling itself The Threateners - now identified as Busby - who expressed anger that the university issued a $50,000 reward for what the email suggested were harmless pranks. Busby, as The Threateners, allegedly emailed the student newspaper, The Pitt News, promising to stop if the university withdrew the reward. The university complied on April 21, although school officials didn't explain then why the reward was being withdrawn. Busby faces 17 counts of wire fraud, each carrying up to 20 years in prison, 16 counts of sending false information or hoaxes each carrying up to 10 years, and two counts of international extortion, which carry up to two years each. The April 21 reward ultimatum wasn't deemed a hoax because the threats stopped after the university withdrew the reward. The extortion counts relate to the ultimatum and a similar April 10 email that the university disregarded as unreliable because it contained misspellings and factual errors, Nordenberg said. The threats cost the school more than $300,000 in direct expenses, including overtime for police and other staff, bomb squads and special equipment to detect such devices. That doesn't include time lost by faculty and students, who were evacuated from dorms at all hours. Busby is the only person so far to be charged in connection with the bomb threats, though federal authorities charged an Ohio man in June with the YouTube video. That man, Alexander Wakeland, 24, of Loveland, Ohio, was charged again Wednesday along with Brett Hudson, 26, of Hillsboro, Ohio, with conspiracy to target Pitt with Internet threats for the video and related emails and tweets from April 25 through May 23. The men, allegedly claiming to be part of the hacking group Anonymous, threatened to release the computer files unless Nordenberg publicly apologized for not safeguarding students from the bomb threats. Pitt officials determined the computer information was never hacked. The men declined to comment when reached by the AP. Hickton said Wakeland and Hudson will turn themselves in next week to be arraigned on the charge, which carries up to five years in prison.\",\n",
       "  \"By . Sara Smyth . At 25, Jenny Dawson seemed to have it all, with a lucrative job as a hedge fund trader, exotic holidays and plenty of trips to extravagant restaurants. But then the maths graduate decided it was time to stir things up. Inspired by her mother’s recipes and memories of her idyllic rural childhood, she swapped the fast-paced world of boardrooms and mega-bucks deals for a simple market stall selling chutneys and preserves made from leftover fruit and vegetables donated by the food industry. Jenny Dawson gave up her lucrative job in the city to start eco-friendly business Rubies in the Rubble. She now makes 1,000 jars of £5 chutney, which is stocked in Waitrose and Fortnum & Mason, per week . Miss Dawson, now 28, sells her chutneys - which are all made from fruit and vegetables that have been thrown away by restaurants and supermarkets - on a stall in London's Borough Market . Three years on, the gamble has paid off after she won the ‘Oscars’ of the business world for her eco-friendly company – which now has an annual turnover of £100,000 and supplies Waitrose and Fortnum & Mason. Yesterday, a thrilled Miss Dawson put her success down to a love of chutney she inherited from her mother Liz – who helped to get her business off the ground by giving her much-needed advice on recipes. ‘My mum was on the other end of the phone talking me through things at the very beginning,’ she said. ‘I made some pretty vile batches – it was a matter of trial and error.’ The maths graduate, pictured winning the New Generation prize at the Veuve Clicquot Business Woman Awards, tributes her success to her mother's recipes . Recalling her childhood in rural Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, she said: ‘Our water came from a well, our fruit and vegetables from our garden and we had a wind turbine installed.’ But after graduating from Edinburgh University with a Master’s in maths and economics, Miss Dawson ended up working in a very different environment – a hedge fund in Central London. She never forgot her passion for all things natural, however. So, to the surprise of her family, she decided to ditch her lucrative career to ‘pick through the rubbish bins’ of the food industry. After collecting the surplus fruit and vegetables from markets or local farmers, she began boiling batches at home and selling them at a stall in London’s Borough Market. Miss Dawson, now 28, said: ‘I went from being able to do exactly what I wanted – going on lovely holidays, having extravagant meals out – to living on a shoestring. I’ve only been able to start paying myself a wage three months ago, so it’s been a long wait. But I wasn’t passionate about finance and if I’d stayed in it for the money I’d have been really upset with myself.’ The entrepreneur, whose father is a beef farmer and whose mother is a ceramic artist, now produces 1,000 jars of chutney a week and hopes to exceed last year’s £100,000 turnover. Her preserves come in six flavours, including apple and ginger, and cost less than £5 per jar. Last night she was awarded the Veuve Clicquot New Generation Award for her innovative company, Rubies in the Rubble. ‘I’m absolutely thrilled,’ she said. ‘When I had a change of heart and told [my family] “I want to make jam from leftover produce” there were a few surprised faces, but they understood the ethos behind my idea. But the most important thing they taught me was about believing in myself and not to be afraid of failure.’ The businesswoman, pictured on her London stall, says her passion for all things natural comes from her rural upbringing in Dumfries, Scotland, where the family's water came from a well and fruit and vegetables from their garden .\",\n",
       "  '(CNN) -- Upon being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs put off surgery for nine months against the advice of his doctors while he tried to treat the disease with a special macrobiotic diet -- a decision he later regretted, his biographer said. When asked why he didn\\'t have the surgery right away, Jobs said, \"I didn\\'t want my body to be opened,\" according to an interview with the biographer, Walter Isaacson, that aired Sunday on CBS News\\' \"60 Minutes.\" By the time Jobs was finally operated on, the cancer had spread to the surrounding tissue, Isaacson said. But his mortality also motivated Jobs, who died October 5, to create some of Apple\\'s boldest products in his final years, Isaacson told CBS\\'s Steve Kroft. \"He talked a lot to me about what happened when he got sick and how it focused him,\" said Isaacson, in a transcript of the show provided by CBS News. \"He said he no longer wanted to go out, no longer wanted to travel the world. He would focus on the products. He knew the couple of things he wanted to do, which was the iPhone and then the iPad. He had a few other visions. I think he would\\'ve loved to have conquered television.\" Isaacson\\'s book, \"Steve Jobs,\" goes on sale Monday. In the \"60 Minutes\" interview, Isaacson described Jobs as a driven, eccentric and sometimes cruel man who grew more reflective and fatalistic in his later years. \"I saw my life as an arc and that it would end, and compared to that nothing mattered,\" Jobs told him in one recorded interview. \"You\\'re born alone, you\\'re going to die alone. And does anything else really matter? I mean, what is it exactly is it that you have to lose, Steve? You know? There\\'s nothing.\" Adopted as a baby, Jobs recalled as a child once confronting his parents in tears about why his real parents had rejected him. His parents sat him down and said, \"No, you don\\'t understand. We specifically picked you out.\" \"He said, \\'From then on, I realized that I was not -- just abandoned. I was chosen. I was special,\\' \" Isaacson said. \"And I think that\\'s the key to understanding Steve Jobs.\" Always something of a rebel, Jobs often thought the usual rules didn\\'t apply to him, Isaacson said. He went through a period as a young man where he didn\\'t bathe regularly -- his managers at Atari made him work the night shift because his co-workers complained about his body odor -- and drove a Mercedes with no license plate because he didn\\'t want people tracking him. Jobs also was a Buddhist and a spiritual person whose religious beliefs were altered by his cancer diagnosis, Isaacson said. \"I remember sitting in his backyard in his garden one day and he started talking about God. He said, \\'Sometimes I believe in God, sometimes I don\\'t. I think it\\'s 50-50 maybe. \"But ever since I\\'ve had cancer, I\\'ve been thinking about it more. And I find myself believing a bit more. I kind of -- maybe it\\'s \\'cause I want to believe in an afterlife. That when you die, it doesn\\'t just all disappear. The wisdom you\\'ve accumulated. Somehow it lives on.\\' \" Isaacson\\'s book is based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs conducted over two years, as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors and colleagues. Simon & Schuster says that although Jobs cooperated with the book, he asked for no control over what was written nor the right to read it before it was published. Isaacson, a former chairman of CNN and the former managing editor of Time magazine, which shares a parent company with CNN, has written biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Henry Kissinger. The 656-page Jobs book retails for $35.',\n",

       "  \"By . Nick Harris for MailOnline . Stevan Jovetic lit up the Etihad Stadium on Monday evening, giving an eye-catching all-round performance for Manchester City that merited his two goals in the 3-1 win over Liverpool and easily deserved his man of the match award. But if you think the 24-year-old Montenegro striker is now destined to be a leading scorer as City romp to the Premier League title, his career to date suggests you better think again. Any strike force is only as strong as its weakest link, and there is no doubt Jovetic remains City’s weakest link among the first-team squad’s four strikers: Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Alvaro Negredo being the others. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pellegrini hail Jovetic . Weakest link: Stevan Jovetic is a decent player but won't fire Manchester City to the title . Superstar: Sergio Aguero slots the ball home seconds after coming on against Liverpool . The real deal: Aguero is the main man at City and theit title hopes will hinge on his form and fitness . Jovetic is evidently a decent ‘weak link.’ He pounced in predatory fashion upon Alberto Moreno’s 41st-minute error to open the scoring last night. Then at the end of a superb second-half move involving 19 passes and an exquisite final exchange with Samir Nasri, he drilled home for 2-0. But one delicious double, or even a few, spaced out, does not a superstar make. Jovetic scored a Champions League brace against Liverpool for Fiorentina in 2009 and is arguably still yet to have a sustained run of top-level consistency, five years later. So while City’s manager Manuel Pellegrini was right  to describe Jovetic, signed in summer 2013 for £22m, as a ‘very important player’, and to stress ‘we never had any doubt about his quality’, he was also right to qualify his statements, saying: ‘If he’s fit all the year, he will be a very important player for us.’ In two of the past four seasons Jovetic has spent much or all of the season injured. He missed the whole of the 2010-11 campaign for Fiorentina with an injury to the cruciate ligament in his right knee. In his debut year with City last season, he made just three league starts (among 13 appearances) as he was variously sidelined with knocks, illness, calf and shin problems and two separate hamstring lay-offs. Strike one: Jovetic hammers in City's opening goal against Liverpool on Monday night . Doubling up: The Montenegro forward (left) makes it two with a good finish in the second half . Stevan's stunner: How Jovetic scored his superb second goal against Liverpool . As a prodigious youngster, Jovetic first played league football for Partizan aged 16 in 2006 and scored his first hat-trick at 17. But starting young means Jovetic’s career already has longevity; this is his 10th season as professional footballer and he has never scored more than 14 league goals in any season. He’s scored league goals in double figures in just three seasons, one of those as a teenager with Partizan. The 14-goal season was with Fiorentina in 2011-12 in a campaign where Jovetic was the leading striker, and main man, but it was a disrupted year of multiple managerial changes\\xa0and ended with a 15th-place finish in Serie A. Monday night’s goals were significant, and in a major game. As Pellegrini said: ‘Liverpool are an important team and one that will be fighting for the title.’ But Jovetic’s three Premier League goals last season, his only three before Monday, were less cases of shooting down major rivals as shooting fish in barrels. Put your shirt on him: Jovetic celebrates a rare Premier League goal last season, against Aston Villa . Bench boy: Jovetic (right) was familiar in his role as a substitute last season . His first goal came in a 5-1 win at 10-man Tottenham, and was the fourth goal of the five. His second goal was in a 4-1 win against Southampton, the fourth goal. His third goal was in a 4-0 win against Aston Villa, the third goal. All were scored with Jovetic in the substitute role, and of course it is not his fault that he was not on the pitch earlier in those games. Having said that, in the pecking order of scorers, Jovetic is very much City’s fourth striker in hard numbers. In all competitions last season, Aguero scored 28 goals in 34 games at a rate of 0.82 per game to make him City’s hottest striker. By the same goals-per-game reckoning (see table below), Dzeko and Negredo were both ahead of Jovetic, as was midfielder Yaya Toure. Taking only league games into consideration, and using the goals-per-game method so as not to penalise players used infrequently, Jovetic was not only behind Aguero, Toure, Dzeko and Negredo but also David Silva. Down the list: Jovetic was the bottom of City's strikers in terms of goals per game last season . International class: The forward captaining Montenegro against England in a World Cup qualifier last year . Announcing himself: A young Jovetic slots the ball past Liverpool's Pepe Reina in 2009 and (below) celebrates . And if you think it is unfair to compare Jovetic to others over one injury-hit season, how does he fare when you compare him over several years against Aguero, Dzeko and Negredo? The answer, in pure goal terms, is he comes fourth of four, whether in terms of goals per game or minutes per goal, in the three full seasons (plus this season) since Jovetic’s full missed season in 2010-11. (See table below). So his relative lack of goals cannot be put down to the fact that he only gets on the pitch for short times. Aguero’s record of one league goal every 113 minutes for three years is stunning; Jovetic’s tally of one every 168 minutes, including last nights two in 80, is fine but not sensational. Having said all that, Jovetic is not a main striker, he is a support striker, as much creator and provider as converter of chances. His problem will be how often he gets into the team when the others are all fit, because while he’s a decent player, he’s not a title-sealer, yet. Propping them up: Jovetic does not come out well when record over the last three seasons are compared .\",\n",
       "  \"By . Sarah Harris . The head of Britain's largest teaching union NASUWT, Chris Keates, said that the cameras were stripping teachers of professionalism . Teachers are being treated like ‘lab rats’ and subjected to Big Brother-style surveillance during lessons, it has been claimed. Schools are using CCTV cameras in classrooms to ‘spy’ on staff and monitor their performance as well as check the times they arrive and leave. Some members of staff are being punished for moving chairs and interrupting colleagues’ lessons after headteachers have reviewed footage. This . ‘excessive monitoring’ comes as rising numbers of state schools across . the country are installing cameras as a safety measure. In . December, principal Neil Houchen came under fire after deciding to . install CCTV cameras in the boys' and girls’ toilets at The Eastwood . Academy, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. The . move formed part of a security crackdown on vandals and bullies, but . parents claimed it was a ‘disgusting’ invasion of privacy. More . than 200 schools across Britain are using CCTV cameras in pupils' toilets or changing rooms, according to a Big Brother Watch report two . years ago. Chris . Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, warned that teachers are also . being ‘undermined and stripped of their professionalism’. She . said: ‘Now in some schools, they are being subjected to permanent . surveillance through CCTV cameras. Lab rats have more professional . privacy.’ Around 7,500 members responded to the . union’s CCTV survey. Nearly one in ten teachers (eight per cent) reported cameras in their classrooms. Of these, 89 per cent said they could not switch off the CCTV and 88 per cent said that it was constantly recording their lessons. Over half (55 per cent) said headteachers viewed the footage and 41 per cent claimed it was being used to ‘find evidence to form negative views about staff’. While teachers acknowledged that CCTV could ‘enhance pupil and staff safety’, a third believed it was an invasion of their professional privacy. A third of teachers believed that the cameras were an invasion of their privacy. Teachers are also unable to turn off the cameras in 89 per cent of cases . Some schools are using CCTV to monitor Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs) who are believed to be under-performing. One teacher surveyed said they were disciplined for visiting another colleague’s classroom – a five minute disruption that had been recorded on tape. ‘This tape was played back at least ten times by the headteacher and a note of the incident has been put on my file for a year,’ he said. Another spotted senior staff members reviewing CCTV footage in the school office. The teacher said:\\xa0 ‘When I asked what my head of department was doing watching a colleague in this way she said she was trying to catch him out.’ A member of staff claimed that CCTV had been used against teachers ‘to imply they are handling a situation incorrectly even though the CCTV has no sound’. It was also used to ‘scare’ staff and to punish them, for example when chairs were moved from one ‘zone’ to another, he added. In December, principal Neil Houchen came under fire after deciding to install CCTV cameras in the boys' and girls' toilets at The Eastwood Academy, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex . A teacher said: ‘In my last school it was routinely used to see what time teachers were in class and what they were doing. It was also used to monitor leaving times.’ One teacher said they received an email from their deputy head during a maths lessons ‘asking me to inform pupils that he was watching them on CCTV’. However, a member of staff claimed that their senior management team had ‘erased CCTV when they have been caught on camera being unprofessional’. Ms Keates said: ‘In some cases, teachers reported having their private conversations filmed when the school was not in session. ‘The stories teachers recounted to us in the survey are a shocking catalogue of professional disrespect and unacceptable intrusion. ‘No other professionals are subjected to such appalling treatment. No one should be subjected to the stress and pressure of being watched constantly. ‘The NASUWT will support members in resisting such practices in schools where such abuse is taking place through all appropriate means, including industrial action.’ Members of the NASUWT will debate a motion condemning the excessive monitoring of teachers at their annual conference in Birmingham today. Last July, a report from the British Security Industry Authority (BSIA) estimated there are between 291,000 and 373,000 cameras in state schools, plus a further 30,000 to 50,000 in independent schools. Chris Keates said: 'Now in some schools, they are being subjected to permanent surveillance through CCTV cameras. Lab rats have more professional privacy'\",\n",

A benefits cheat who claimed to be wheelchair-bound is facing a hefty jail sentence after swindling £1.5m to fund a luxury lifestyle, including scuba diving holidays and a high-powered motorbike. Barry Brooks, 49, who claimed he was unable to climb stairs, had to use an electric wheelchair and could not lift anything heavier than a sandwich, set up a business aimed at helping get disabled people into work entitling him to receive grants. He then siphoned off cash into his own accounts. The self-styled ‘Knight’, who insisted on being called ‘Sir Barry’, stole hundreds of thousands of pounds for himself in claims put through the fake business for taxis to the office and support. 'Sir Barry': Brooks, 49, claimed he was unable to climb stairs, had to use an electric wheelchair and could not lift anything heavier than a sandwich yet was able to play in a swimming pool while holidaying in Gran Canaria . Devious: Brooks set up a business aimed at helping get disabled people into work entitling him to receive grants. He then siphoned off cash into his own accounts . Disability claims made on behalf of other ‘employees’ meant that £1million worth of grants went to the company, making the scam amount to £1.5m . The monthly claims on behalf of the company were submitted by Derek Arnold, 55, named as a co-director of the company and who described himself as Brooks’s 'sexual playmate'. Brooks, of Bromley, south east London, was put under surveillance at the end of 2009 and a search of the Bromley house he shared with Arnold revealed photographs of the pair on holiday together. Photographs included Brooks diving . around a wreck in Gran Canaria, playing ball games in a swimming pool . and driving a high-powered Suzuki motorcycle. He even ran his own . motorcycle shop. Taxi . receipts along with an extensive range of wine and other alcohol, a . newly fitted kitchen and evidence of a gym membership indicating the . pair were living in ‘comfort’ were also found. Extravagant: Brooks was put under surveillance in 2009 and a search of his Bromley house revealed photographs of him diving around a wreck in Gran Canaria . Brooks . claimed he would wear a support called a reciprocating gait orthosis, . which enabled him to walk, but nothing of the sort was found at his . home. He also claimed he . had a specially adapted motorcycle suit which enabled him to wear the . contraption underneath, but that he could not get on and off the bike . himself. The court heard that Dr Michael . Gross, a consultant neurologist called as an expert witness for the . prosecution, had reached the conclusion that Brooks 'was elaborating his . circumstances to convince or deceive, otherwise known in medical terms . as malingering. 'It is impossible to come to any conclusion other than that there is an elaboration to deceive,' he said. The court heard prosecutor Andrew Marshall turn to Brooks and say: 'Arise Sir Barry'. Brooks . and his co-defendants were involved in setting up the ‘Access Audit . Corporation’ (AAC), in 2004 to provide training and advice services to . disabled people, but found a way to defraud the access to work programme . - funded by the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP). Lies: There were also photographs of him riding a powerful Suzuki motorbike unaided . Able bodied: Brooks claimed he would wear a support called a reciprocating gait orthosis which enabled him to walk, but nothing of the sort was found at his home . Once a disabled person finds work, they may need grants to assist them in getting to work, travel whilst at work and support - and monthly claims were submitted on behalf of AAC and Brooks himself. Mr Marshall, prosecuting, said: 'What the evidence has revealed is a wholesale assault on a part of the benefit system that was designed to assist some of the more vulnerable members of our society.' It is not just the figures that are surprising, he said, 'but the audacity, the confidence and the cynicism with which this was done over a very long time'. He said Brooks had an ‘extremely persuasive and charismatic personality’ and still had supporters who saw no wrong in him despite the overwhelming evidence against him. Southwark Crown Court heard he even managed to dupe medical professionals to advance his fraudulent claims. Lover: The monthly claims made on behalf of Brooks' company were submitted by Derek Arnold, 55, named as a co-director and who described himself as Brooks's 'sexual playmate' Simon Clements, Head of Welfare, Health and Rural Prosecutions at the CPS said: 'Barry Brooks and his associates claimed . to run a business that would help people with disabilities get back to . work. Today, that business was confirmed as a complete sham. 'From the outset, Brooks himself . exaggerated very minor injuries to falsely claim £1.2m through the . government's Access to Work scheme. 'Despite his claims that he could not . walk unaided and was forced to live on the ground floor of his home, . Brooks had gym membership, was an active advanced scuba diver, and . holiday snaps show him jumping energetically into a swimming pool.' They . had surveillance going back to 2010 showing Brooks walking, shopping . and driving unaided, he said, and towards the end of 2011 there is also . evidence he was actively managing a pub. He continued: 'He has been a very active scuba diver, reaching advanced diver status...This is a clear sham. He was physically able to carry out all these activities but at the same time was purporting to be severely disabled in order to make these claims.' Brooks along with Arnold were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud. Brooks was found . guilty of obtaining a living allowance dishonestly by . stating he was dependent on his children for lifting and carrying on a . form dated May 30, 2009. Both men will be sentenced at a later date. Judge Beddoe said he expected Brooks, who spent the entire trial in a wheelchair, to be standing when he sentenced him. Arnold was also convicted on a charge of making a false . representation in order to obtain benefit. Co-defendants Robert Harris, 55, and John White, 78, were cleared of conspiracy to defraud. It . can also now be revealed that Arnold may face further criminal charges . after being linked to a blog apparently accusing the trial judge of . corruption. Arnold is . thought to be the behind a series of postings uploaded to the internet . under the title 'Diogenese Associates' in which repeated references have . been made to his trial. One . posting uploaded on July 15, which has now been removed from the . internet, showed a picture of Judge Beddoe next to the heading . 'Corruption at Southwark Crown Court number 8?'. The . article states at one point: 'One imagines and hopes that if we're . every [sic] brought to trial that we'll be assured of a fair hearing and . that our voice will be heard - this isn't necessarily the case . however.' It goes on to list a series of pieces . of 'evidence' said to have been withheld from jurors trying the case in . what it describes as a bid to 'to prevent justice; to allow the . prosecution to hold the upper hand and to ensure that the defence is at a . disadvantage'. The . blog concludes by saying: 'Justice be damned, it's face-saving and . cost-saving that counts here; hiding prosecution and CPS mistakes is . what counts.' After . hearing of the blog Judge Beddoe remanded Arnold in custody for the . remainder of the trial saying it was necessary to 'take a preventative . measure which may prevent further publication of this kind'. Blog: Arnold may face further criminal charges after being linked to a blog apparently accusing the trial judge of corruption . Several . other posts, not mentioned in court but still online, also refer to the . case. One, from July 15, entitled 'Careful, there's more of them - out . of the wheelchair and onto the bike' discusses disabled motorcyclists.

       "  'Washington (CNN) -- Federal firearms agents in Arizona cringed every time they heard of a shooting after letting waves of guns pass into the hands of Mexican drug gangs, some of those agents told a House committee Wednesday. It was part of an operation aimed at tracking the flow of weapons across the U.S.-Mexican border, but the operation has come under intense criticism since the December killing of a U.S. Border Patrol officer. Operation Fast and Furious, as the program was known, was \"a colossal failure of leadership,\" said Peter Forcelli, a supervisor at the Phoenix field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. When U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was wounded and six others were killed in a January assassination attempt in Tucson, Forcelli said, an agency spokesman told him \"that there was concern from the chain of command that the gun was hopefully not a Fast and Furious gun.\" Another agent, Lee Casa, said, \"This happened time and time again.\" \"Every time there\\'s a shooting, whether it was Mrs. Giffords or anybody, any time there is a shooting in the general Phoenix area or even in, you know, Arizona, we\\'re fearful that it might be one of these firearms,\" Casa told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The killings of three people connected with the U.S. consulate in Juarez, Mexico, caused similar anxiety, Casa said. And a third agent, John Dodson, told lawmakers: \"I cannot begin to think of how the risk of letting guns fall into the hands of known criminals could possibly advance any legitimate law enforcement interest. I hope the committee will receive a better explanation than I.\" Operation Fast and Furious focused on following \"straw purchasers,\" or people who legally bought weapons that were then transferred to criminals and destined for Mexico. But instead of intercepting the weapons when they switched hands, Operation Fast and Furious called for ATF agents to let the guns \"walk\" and wait for them to surface in Mexico, according to a committee report. The idea was that once the weapons in Mexico were traced back to the straw purchasers, the entire arms smuggling network could be brought down. Instead, the report argues, letting the weapons slip into the wrong hands was a deadly miscalculation that resulted in preventable deaths, including that of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. Terry was killed last year just north of the Mexican border in Arizona after he confronted a group of bandits believed to be preying on illegal immigrants. Two weapons found near the scene of the killing were traced to Fast and Furious. \"I was flabbergasted. I couldn\\'t believe it at first,\" Terry\\'s mother, Josephine, said of when she learned that the ATF may have let some of the guns used in the attack slip through its fingers. Terry\\'s family said they want all those involved in his killing and who helped put the weapons in their hands to be prosecuted. \"We ask that if a government official made a wrong decision, that they admit their error and take responsibility for his or her actions,\" Robert Heyer, Terry\\'s cousin and family spokesman, testified. The committee\\'s chairman, California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, called the operation \"felony stupid.\" As many as 2,000 semi-automatic rifles reached the hands of the cartels as a result, and Issa said the top two ATF officials were briefed the program regularly. Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich testified that the ATF never knowingly allowed the sale of assault weapons to straw purchasers, who then transported them into Mexico. But Issa and other congressmen said the claim was deceiving. Although it is technically true that straw purchasers didn\\'t cross any weapons into Mexico, they did transfer them to third parties who did, they said. Issa also was upset over heavily redacted documents that his committee had received from the attorney general\\'s office. Weich said his office was cooperating to the greatest extent possible, given concerns about disrupting the ongoing investigation. But Weich said he did not know or was not able to answer questions about who authorized the operation. \"The attorney general has said he wants to get to the bottom of it,\" he said. Speaking before the committee, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said that the operation started with the flawed assumption that there was a large arms trafficking network that was operating. \"That kind of assumption can cause you to start with a conclusion and work backwards, looking for facts that fit the case. Until you figure out that you\\'ve got the cart before the horse, you\\'re probably not going to get anywhere,\" he said. Casa said ATF supervisors in Phoenix, where the project was based, brushed off several agents\\' concerns over letting guns go. And Dodson said that despite evidence that straw purchasers were giving their weapons to cartels, the agency went no further than to do some surveillance. \"Knowing all the while, just days after these purchases, the guns that we saw these individuals buy would begin turning up at crime scenes in the United States and Mexico, we still did nothing,\" he said. Forcelli, also criticized the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in Arizona for what he described as a tendency not to prosecute arms trafficking cases, and said \"toothless\" laws against straw buyers made it difficult to recruit low-level operatives as witnesses. \"With these types of cases, for somebody to testify against members of a cartel where the alternative is seeing a probation officer once a month, they\\'re going to opt toward not cooperating with the law enforcement authorities,\" he said.',\n",
       "  \"When Tottenham paid £26million for Roberto Soldado they knew they were getting a quality striker with proven experience at the highest level. He'd won La Liga, he'd represented Spain. But things haven't worked out as planned for the former Valencia man. Here, Dan Kilpatrick of Spurs blog TheTottenhamWay.com shares his views on why supporters are still showing faith in the struggling forward. Tottenham forward Roberto Soldado has only managed to score four goals in all competitions this season . Striker Roberto Soldado (right) contrived to miss a chance to score against Burnley with the goal gaping . It looked like he'd reached breaking point, finally. Roberto Soldado dropped to his knees in despair, eyes wide with disbelief. Andros Townsend, sensing this was no time to mourn a lost assist, rushed over to console his teammate. Once they'd recovered from the shock, the Spurs fans, aided by the excellent 1882 movement, began singing: 'Viva Soldado, oooh-oh; he came from sunny Spain; to play with Harry Kane.' Spurs trailed Burnley 2-1 in the FA Cup and Soldado, not for the first time, had missed a sitter. With the goal gaping, the Spaniard blazed Townsend's on a plate cross into the stands from five yards out. It was no exaggeration to say it was easier to score. It was his worst miss to date and there was nothing and no-one else to blame; not the service, not the system, not the Premier League. Fortunately, Spurs went on to win 4-2 but the result hardly spared Soldado's blushes. The miss was the main talking point after the match and Townsend, Mauricio Pochettino and Soldado himself all had their say on it. The Spain international reacts to the miss by dropping to his knees as White Hart Lane . Andros Townsend (left) has revealed that he offered some words of encouragement to Soldado at half-time . For a Premier League player, it was inexcusable and it could have cost Tottenham dear. Yet support for Soldado from the terraces remained unwavering. There cannot be many players at Spurs – Kane and Hugo Lloris maybe – towards whom there is so much support and goodwill. Adoration for Kane and Lloris is understandable. They are both quality players, at the top of their games. Soldado, however, is not. The striker has scored one league goal this season, fewer than Eric Dier, and seven in his Spurs career. That's a league goal every 360 minutes or every 840 minutes excluding penalties. To his credit, Soldado did not crumble. Having already assisted Paulinho, he set-up another for Danny Rose with a pinpoint cross. This is part of the reason Spurs fans sing for Soldado. A lesser player would've hidden, allowed his head to drop, but Soldado continued to work for the team. His overall performance – which some confused with his miss – was impressive. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino reacts after Soldado's miss during their FA Cup match against Burnley . Soldado scored 24 league goals in his final season at Valencia before securing Spurs move . His goalscoring form has been wretched, catastrophic since a £26m move from Valencia but he still continues to stay positive, give his all, revel in his teammates' successes and display a mingled sense of agony and humour about his misses (see his incredulous smile after his shot rebounded off the post allowing Benji Stambouli to score against Partizan). White Hart Lane loves a striker and, after years of yearning for a big-money forward, fans are not about to give up on Soldado. They recognise that he's a good player suffering from a sustained crisis of form and confidence, rather than a Gregorz Rasiak-type, hopelessly out of his depth. On the pitch, he is passionate and apologetic. He seems to genuinely care. He's classy. Off it, he appears humble and family-minded. These are endearing qualities to supporters, while the mocking he receives at the hands of the media and rival fans makes Spurs supporters all the more desperate to see him succeed. It's also worth saying that fans singing for Soldado are singing for the club, too. He was a huge investment and selling Bobby for a significant loss would hurt Tottenham. We are desperate to see him perform, for everyone's sake. Others simply recognise that Soldado, now more than ever, must be close to that breaking point. He needs more support than anyone and he's getting it. He will continue to get it. You can follow Dan on Twitter @TheTottenhamWay\\xa0and on Facebook .\",\n",
       "  'Maybe it’s his enormous, bulging brown eyes. Or the permanently wrinkled up-turned nose. Or it could be his pointy, over-sized ears. There’s little doubt that Alan, a diminutive five-month-old French bulldog, has a certain je ne sais quoi. ‘Most people associate bulldogs exclusively with England, but this one’s different and definitely full of character,’ says Alan’s besotted owner, Lisa Bristow, a 31-year-old marketing director from London. ‘I can’t walk him down the street without people stopping and admiring him.’ All ears: French bulldogs are loved for their comical looks . They aren’t the only ones. The French bulldog — a kind of ‘bulldog-lite’ which emerged in the 19th century when traditional bulldogs were mated with pugs and terriers to create a miniature version — is one of the fastest growing breeds in Britain, with owners willing to pay £1,000 for one. Last year, the Kennel Club received 6,990 new French bulldog registrations — an increase of 49 per cent on the previous year and of more than 1,000 per cent compared to ten years ago. Enthusiasm for ‘Frenchies’ as fans call them, far exceeds enthusiasm for traditional British bulldogs — the Kennel Club had a thousand fewer registrations for the British breed. Celebrity owners include the Beckhams, whose Frenchie Scarlet is a regular fixture on Victoria’s Twitter page — as well as fashion designer Henry Holland, former Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh and the Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon. X-Men star Hugh Jackman is rarely seen without his cream-coloured French bulldog Dali, while Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding is devoted to her French bulldog Yogi. So what is it about the Frenchie that has turned it into the dog du jour? X-Men star Hugh Jackman is rarely seen without his cream-coloured French bulldog Dali . Certainly not their looks. With their squashed snouts, bulging eyes, stocky bodies and squat spindly legs, they’re unlikely to win any beauty prizes. But for owners, their comical appearance is part of the charm. ‘They are known as the clowns of the canines, and it’s so true,’ says Daisy Dickinson, a 27-year-old beauty writer from Cambridge, whose dog is five-year-old Roxy. Fans often post photos online of their Frenchies dressed up to look as ridiculous as possible. Some dogs have become celebrities in their own right. Sir Charles Barkley, a 21-month-old cream Frenchie, appeared on a range of canine ‘hoodies’ after his owners set up an Instagram photo account that\\xa0 attracted 200,000 followers on the picture-sharing site. Another, Trotter, has nearly 190,000. He is beloved for his exhaustive collection of hats. French Bulldogs are particularly well-suited to owners who live in cities and work long hours. They rarely grow taller than 12 inches or weigh much more than 2st, and dislike extreme temperatures, so are suited to indoor-living. They enjoy human company, are affectionate with owners, and good with children. It’s not the first time Frenchies have experienced a moment in the spotlight. They were all the rage in mid-19th century France. Despite their name, the dogs partly originated in Britain. They were introduced to the Continent by Nottingham’s lace workers who, displaced by machinery after the Industrial Revolution, moved to Normandy in search of work. In Britain, breeders had seen their size as a defect, but by the 1850s in France, they had become a Parisian must-have, known as ‘bouledogues francais’ and popular among artists, writers and high-society ladies. Their return to favour now fits with a longer-term trend for diminutive breeds, or ‘handbag dogs’, which has already seen chihuahuas, pugs and miniature poodles enjoy a place in the spotlight. Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko says: ‘People see a picture of a celebrity out carrying a small dog and want one, too.’ But although responsibly-bred Frenchies can enjoy long and healthy lives, living for more than a decade, the breed is prone to health problems. Their short snouts and compact heads, the result of centuries of selective breeding, mean their airways are compacted. They struggle to regulate their temperature, and find breathing in warm weather difficult. Exposure to extreme heat can be lethal. A French bulldog has his teeth cleaned at the Harrods pet parlour . They also have notoriously delicate digestive systems, a reputation for flatulence and a tendency to allergies. French bulldogs can suffer spine and knee pain, and tend to suffer eye problems, such as glaucoma, corneal ulcers and cataracts. The Kennel Club has a register of ‘assured’ breeders on its website, who have been checked over and will only register certain colours of the breed — ‘brindle’, a mix of coloured and black hairs, such as Alan and Roxy; ‘pied’, predominantly white; and ‘fawn’, similar to brindle but with black eyelashes and rims. Other colours, such as the grey-black . ‘blue’ bulldog beloved of celebrities are not approved because they . often suffer from a condition which can result in hair loss and chronic . skin inflammation. Frenchie fans insist that - when properly looked after, this is a breed which can rival any other . And breeders with no Kennel Club affiliation advertise French bulldog puppies online — including Blues — for anything from £500 to £1,600. Frequently, they are based abroad. Some unscrupulous Eastern Europeans breed them in pitiful conditions, and because pets from the EU no longer need to be quarantined, smuggling puppies has never been easier. Last year, the number of dogs coming from Romania increased by more than 1,000 per cent. Another unexpected side-effect of the craze has been the recent wave in bulldog thefts. In February, a seven-month-old French bulldog puppy was stolen from a garden in Aberdare, but was recovered two weeks later. A month earlier, a five-month-old French bulldog was stolen from a home in Stratford-upon-Avon. And a man wielding a knife seized a two-year-old French bulldog from a home in Huddersfield in December. Frenchie fans insist that — when properly looked after, this is a breed which can rival any other. ‘With careful, knowledgeable breeding and care, they can be healthy, lovable, funny little dogs with huge personalities and with no more or less problems than your average Labrador,’ adds Daisy Dickinson. As for Roxy’s status as a fashion icon — it’s just an added bonus. ‘I can see why they’ve stolen the hearts of so many\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009. Roxy’s my best friend and I adore her.’',\n",
       "  \"By . Fiona Macrae . Scientists have programmed a computer to read people’s dreams. They claim their invention, the ‘dream catcher’ is 60 per cent accurate. The level of detail is still far from that in the Leonardo DiCaprio film Inception, in which people manipulate people’s dreams and steal their sleeping thoughts. Scientists have programmed a computer to read people's dreams, and it is 60 per cent accurate. The level of detail is still far from that in the Leonardo DiCaprio film Inception, in which people manipulate people¿s dreams and steal their sleeping thoughts . However, experts have described the work, detailed in the respected journal Science, as ‘stunning’. They added that just a few years ago such a feat would have been firmly in the realms of Star Trek, at best. The Japanese scientists began by scanning the brains of three volunteers as they slept in an MRI machine. Every six or seven minutes, they were prodded awake and asked to describe any dream they’d been having. The study has been described as 'stunning in its detail and success' The process was repeated until each participant had recounted at least 200 dreams. One drowsy man told the researchers: ‘From the sky, I saw something like a bronze statue, a big bronze statue. ‘The bronze statue existed on a small hill.\\xa0 Below the hill, there were houses, streets and trees.’ Another volunteer said: ‘I hid a key in a place between a chair and a bed and someone took it.’ The descriptions were analysed and the key themes for each participant placed into twenty categories. Examples of categories include men, women, tools, books and cars. Next, the volunteers, who were by now wide awake, were shown photos corresponding to things from the categories and their brains scanned once more. A computer programme quickly learnt to pick out the brain activity ‘signatures’ for each category. In the final part of the experiment, the computer put its knowledge to use, by trying to decode the brain scans of the volunteers as they slept once more. Amazingly, the computer identified the sort of images being dreamt about 60 per cent of the time. This is far higher than would occur due to chance alone, says researcher Yukiyasu Kamitani, of ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto. Some neuroscientists said that the volunteers were sleeping so lightly during the study that they weren’t technically dreaming. According to American imaging experts, convicts showing low activity in an area of the brain associated with decision-making and action are more likely to be arrested again. A\\xa0 group of 96 male prisoners underwent MRI scans shortly before they were due to be released, while they were carrying out computer tasks in which subjects had to make quick decisions and inhibit impulsive reactions.The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to focus on activity in a section of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) -\\xa0 a small region in the front of the brain involved in motor control and executive functioning. They then followed the subjects for four years. Among the ex-criminals studied, those who had lower ACC activity during the quick-decision tasks were more likely to be arrested again after getting out of prison. But the researchers believe that the dreaming of deep sleep may be very similar. US neuroscientist and dream expert Dr Robert Stickgold, from Harvard Medical School in Boston, said we are still far from having a machine that can fully read our dreams. But, despite this, he described the study as ‘stunning in its detail and success’. He told Science: ‘This is probably the first real demonstration of the brain basis of dream content.’ Dr Stickgold said the research proved, for the first time, that when people describe their dreams they are at least close to being accurate. ‘Up until this moment, there were no grounds on which to say we don't just make up our dreams when we wake up.’ He added that in future, the technique could be used to help us remember forgotten dreams. Similar technology has been used in rudimentary mind-reading of people when they are awake.\",\n",

It seemed turtle was definitely on the menu when one was cornered by two giant crocodiles. But, incredibly, instead of becoming lunch it was allowed to bask in the hot South Carolina sun on the back of one of the predators. The amazing picture was taken by photographer Mac Stone, who had to set up an intricate camera rig to capture the creatures in their natural habitat. Unlikely alliance: Instead of eating the turtle the alligator allows it to sit on its back as they bask in the river . Mr Stone spent four months in the stifling heat of the Francis Beidler Forest tracking the animals. But he was unable to get the picture he wanted because the shy creatures would sink into the water when he appeared. So the photographer built a rig on the log to allow him to catch the animals behaving naturally.

       "  \"Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond once appeared in an obscure Pakistani soap opera, it emerged today. Mr Salmond, who is standing for Parliament in May, made a brief cameo appearance in 'The Castle' – a 15 part romantic thriller partially filmed in Scotland in 2001. The former SNP leader said he was even given acting lessons by the  Hollywood star Sean Connery before he made his acting debut. Alex Salmond, Scotland's former First Minister, made a brief cameo appearance in 'The Castle' – a 15 part Pakistani romantic thriller . He was approached to appear in the soap by SNP activist Tasmina Sheikh - the show's producer who is married to the famous Bollywood producer Sulfkar - when Mr Salmond stood down as party leader the first time when he was an MP in 2000. The soap was partly filmed partly at Scotland's Wedderburn Castle near Duns in the Borders. The plot follows an Asian businessman who marries a Scot and inherits her family home after her death.\\xa0Mr Salmond plays a ghost who guides him through his troubles while at the castle. Despite the ghost's presence throughout the production, Mr Salmond's only personal appearance was in the last episode. Mr Salmond was approached to appear in the soap by SNP activist Tasmina Sheikh, the show's producer who is married to the famous Bollywood producer Sulfkar . Mr Salmond, who is standing for Parliament in May, was even name-checked in the soap opera's credits . Mr Salmond told\\xa0BuzzFeed News: 'My Bollywood cameo as a ghostly spirit was filmed the last time I stood down as SNP leader. This time round I'm hoping to haunt the House of Commons, rather like Banquo's ghost. 'It was, it has to be said, a non-speaking role – not one I hope to assume in Westminster. 'As you would expect, I took some acting lessons from Sean Connery at the time to make sure the audience was both shaken and stirred.' The revelation comes as Mr Salmond plots his return to the House of Commons amid speculation he could even become Deputy Prime Minister in a Labour-led Government. Mr Salmond and his successor as First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have vowed to implement left-wing policies on Tory England if the SNP holds the balance of power after the next election. The former First Minister, who is standing for Parliament in May, said he would work with other parties except the Tories to 'see more progressive politics introduced across these islands'. Mrs Sturgeon yesterday gave a speech in London warning Labour that it would have to abandon 'failed' austerity policies and back a £180billion spending splurge to form a coalition with the SNP after the election. She said her party, which could hold the balance of power after May's general election, would require Ed Miliband to adopt a 'more moderate' approach to deficit reduction if he wanted the backing of SNP MPs in Westminster. The First Minister suggested an alternative approach for the next parliament which would see £180 billion extra spent on public services by 2020.\",\n",

       "  \"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 09:46 EST, 22 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:32 EST, 22 July 2013 . The estranged wife of the driver who was at the wheel of a limo that burst into flames killing five female passengers claims he was arguing with her over the phone just before the disaster. Rachel 'Raquel' Hernandez-Brown has said Orville 'Ricky' Brown, 46, was distracted, and even turned up the music in the limo so the bachelorette party in the back couldn't hear him fighting with his ex. Bride-to-be Neriza Fojas, 31, and four of her friends died after becoming trapped in the blazing limousine on the San Mateo Bridge in San Francisco in May - a further four bachelorettes and driver Mr Brown managed to escape. Distracted: A bride-to-be and four of her friends were killed when the limousine they were travelling in burst into flames on the San Mateo Bridge in San Francisco . Ms Hernandez-Brown said the music in the limo was 'really loud', adding that she told her estranged husband 'You're not paying attention', and 'stop calling me'. In an interview at her San Jose home she also recalled telling him: 'I'd hate to have a limo driver like you.' Mr Brown was calling to try and make up after a violent outburst that was investigated by police earlier in the day she said, according to a report on Mercurynews.com. Her remarks have raised questions over whether the driver was too distracted to react quickly when one of the women banged on the partition to get his attention after realising the vehicle was filling with smoke. Devastation: Driver Orville Brown's estranged wife has claimed he was arguing with her over the phone in the moments before the vehicle began to fill with smoke . 'We need to follow up on this,' Karen Guidotti, chief deputy San Mateo County district attorney, said on Friday when confronted with the content of the interview. Police had never contacted Ms Hernandez-Brown. Mr Brown said he was not 'authorised' to talk to journalists or give interviews on Thursday, and declined to comment on his wife's account of the moments leading up to the fire on Saturday. In the days after the fatal fire on May 4, Mr Brown recounted the ordeal in numerous television interviews. He has insisted he did everything he could to get the women out of the car but that the flames were too intense. Probe: The five women were trapped in the limo when it caught fire on Saturday May 4, while four others, and driver Orvile Brown, managed to escape . He said someone from another car finally wrenched open one of the Lincoln Town Car's back doors. Moments later he called his ex once again to tell her what was happening. 'My mom, I, everyone in my family were like, gosh, what made him not call the cops right away?' Ms Hernandez-Brown said in her interview. One survivor said in the wake of the blaze that the driver did nothing to help the trapped women escape. She declined to comment on his wife's claims. She and three other women escaped after climbing through the partition separating the driver's section from the passengers, but five others died in the limo. The investigation into what caused the blaze is yet to conclude. Mr Brown, 46, was born into a well-known Bay Area family. Lewis Brown Sr., his father, was the first African-American elected to the Vallejo City Council. He is also related to Charles Bledsoe, one of the attorneys who worked on the landmark 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education school-segregation case. Orville Brown had worked for the limo company for about two months after a long period without a steady job, Ms Hernandez-Brown said. She said he told her that the fire could be a windfall for them, saying, 'We're going to get super-paid'. But Hernandez-Brown insisted she didn't want anything to do with 'blood money'. The report said Mr Brown used his phone to film the smouldering remains of the limo and text the footage to his wife with the words: '...Remember this could off [SIC] put me in the ground...'.\",\n",
       "  '(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Tuesday ordered the makers of certain antibiotics to add a \"black box\" label warning -- the FDA\\'s strongest -- to alert patients of possible tendon ruptures and tendonitis. Cipro is one of the drugs for which the FDA will require a \"black box\" label warning about tendon problems. \"The new language will strengthen the existing warnings,\" said Dr. Edward Cox, director of the FDA\\'s Office of Antimicrobial Products. The FDA is requiring the label warnings and a medication guide for fluoroquinolone drugs, which include Cipro, Levaquin, Avelox, Noroxin and Floxin. The consumer group Public Citizen asked the FDA in August 2006 to put the \"black box\" warning on Cipro and other fluoroquinolones, and also to warn doctors. Earlier this year, Public Citizen filed a lawsuit to force the FDA to take those actions. Public Citizen said Tuesday it was \"pleased\" with the FDA\\'s order but added \"there is still more that the FDA must do.\" \"The FDA is silent on our request that it also send a warning letter to physicians clearly describing possible adverse reactions, such as tendon pain, so that patients can be switched to alternative treatments before tendons rupture,\" the group said. \"We are troubled that the FDA is not doing everything within its power to prevent more people from needlessly suffering disabling tendon ruptures.\" When asked about the lawsuit and why it didn\\'t order the \"black box\" label warning until now, Cox stressed that the FDA included warning information with the drugs from 2001 until 2004, and updated the information last year.  Dr. Gupta explains more on antibiotic risks » . \"There has been ongoing work to update the labeling of the fluoroquinolone drug products,\" Cox said. \"We have been working on this issue and making progress over time.\" The companies that make the fluoroquinolone drugs will be required to submit label safety changes and the medication guide within 30 days of receiving the notification from the FDA or provide a reason why they do not believe such labeling changes are necessary, Cox said. Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc., which holds licenses for Cipro and Avelox, said it would make the changes requested by the FDA but defended the drugs as \"well-tolerated and effective in all approved indications.\" Schering-Plough markets Cipro and Avelox in the United States under agreement with Bayer. Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which markets Levaquin in the United States, also said it would abide by the FDA\\'s request. Merck & Co., the maker of Noroxin, said it, too, would update the drug\\'s label. But Merck noted it has stopped promotion of Noroxin because of the widespread availability of its generic form. Oscient Pharmaceuticals (Factive), Daiichi Sankyo (Floxin) and Dipomed (Proquin) did not immediately respond to CNN\\'s requests for comment. The fluoroquinolones drugs can increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture -- which is about 1 in 100,000 -- by three to four times, according to the FDA\\'s Dr. Renata Albrecht. \"This risk is further increased in those over age 60, in kidney, heart, and lung transplant recipients, and with use of concomitant steroid therapy,\" the FDA said in a statement. Albrecht said that sometimes patients have no symptoms before they experience a rupture in their tendon -- commonly their Achilles tendon. \"Sometimes it\\'s been reported on the first day of taking a fluoroquinolone ... a sudden snap or popping sound that is tendon rupture with no preceding warning,\" she said. Normally, she added, that patients experience some pain or inflammation \"a week or two before the patient will rupture.\" Public Citizen, founded in 1971 by consumer activist Ralph Nader, said more than 400 cases of tendon rupture and more than 300 cases of tendonitis in patients using fluoroquinolones were reported between November 1997 and December 2007. \"Because only a small fraction of cases are typically reported to the FDA, the actual number of ruptures and other tendon injuries attributable to the antibiotic is much higher,\" the group said. The FDA would only say that it has received \"hundreds\" of reports of tendon problems linked to fluoroquinolones, without being more specific, citing the ongoing lawsuit. But Cox said \"the FDA continues to receive a considerable number of reports on tendon adverse effects.\" Patients should stop taking fluoroquinolone antibiotics at the first sign of tendon pain, avoid exercise and contact their doctor, the FDA said. Cox said the FDA would not require companies to send letters to doctors alerting them about the connection between tendon problems and the antibiotics. \"It is possible under REMS [Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy] to ask for a letter [to doctors],\" Cox said. \"Certainly for sponsors that would choose to go forward with a letter, we\\'ll be happy to work with them.\"',\n",
       "  'Philadelphia (CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way for death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal to get a new sentencing hearing for the killing of a Philadelphia police officer 30 years ago. The high court rejected a request from the Philadelphia District Attorney\\'s Office to overturn the federal appeals court decision declaring the death sentence unconstitutional for Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther who was convicted in 1982 of gunning down a Philadelphia police officer. Abu-Jamal will be automatically sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole unless Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams seeks another death sentence from a new jury. Williams had no comment Tuesday. His attorneys, who have repeatedly argued that confusing jury instructions and the verdict form given to the jury favored a death sentence instead of life in prison, applauded the court\\'s ruling. \"At long last, the profoundly troubling prospect of Mr. Abu-Jamal facing an execution that was produced by an unfair and unreliable penalty phase has been eliminated. Like all Americans, Mr. Abu-Jamal was entitled to a proper proceeding that takes into account the many substantial reasons why death was an inappropriate sentence,\" John Payton, director of the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, said in a statement. Abu-Jamal\\'s case will now return to the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas for final sentencing. In April, Abu-Jamal was granted a new sentencing hearing by a federal appeals court, sparking a threat by the prosecutor to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. In its 32-page decision, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals accepted defense arguments that the jury instructions at Abu-Jamal\\'s original 1982 murder trial were unclear. The court\\'s decision does not grant Abu-Jamal a new trial and his conviction of murder stands. In January, the Supreme Court tossed out a lower court ruling that nullified the death sentence for Abu-Jamal. The justices ordered a federal appeals court to revisit its earlier ruling granting a new sentencing hearing. The high court last year denied Abu-Jamal\\'s separate petition for a new trial . Abu-Jamal was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1981 killing of Officer Daniel Faulkner. Witnesses testified that Abu-Jamal shot Faulkner in the back and head after the officer pulled his brother over during a late-night traffic stop. Abu-Jamal, once known as Wesley Cook, was wounded in the encounter and later confessed to the killing, according to other testimony. He\\'s been on death row at a state prison in southwest Pennsylvania, where he\\'s been an outspoken activist from behind bars -- claiming there were procedural errors during his capital sentencing, and that too few blacks were on the jury. The case has attracted international attention, amid charges of prosecutorial misconduct. Abu-Jamal, a onetime radio reporter and cab driver, has been a divisive figure, with many prominent supporters arguing that racism pervaded his trial. Others counter Abu-Jamal is using his race to try to escape responsibility for his actions. They say he has provoked community unrest for years with his writings and advocacy.',\n",
       "  \"Memory loss: Forgetting where you put your keys or someone's name is a perfectly normal part of the aging process and well underway by the age of 40, scientists have said . Forgetting where you put your keys or someone's name is a perfectly normal part of the aging process and well underway by the age of 40, scientists have said. Experts have found that cognitive decline speeds up once people reach middle age, however, they are working on a solution to the problem. They believe the answer lies in the NDMA receptors in the brain, in particular the receptors GluN2B subunits which help people to remember things. These subunits start to be lost among small children, and by the time a person reaches retirement age they will have around half the amount of someone much younger. Separate this loss from more serious problems like dementia and Alzheimer's disease, virtually everyone loses memory-making and cognitive abilities as they age. Researchers at the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University have clarified that cognitive decline with age is a natural part of life and are searching hard to find ways of slowing it. 'These are biological processes, and once we fully understand what is going on, we may be able to slow\\xa0 or prevent it,' said Kathy Magnusson, a neuroscientist in the OSU Department of Biomedical Sciences and professor in the Linus Pauling Institute. 'There may be ways to influence it with diet, health habits, continued mental activity or even drugs.' Professor Magnusson added: 'The NMDA receptor has been known of for decades. It plays a role in memory and learning but isn't active all the time, it takes a fairly strong stimulus of some type to turn it on and allow you to remember something. 'The routine of getting dressed in the morning is ignored and quickly lost to the fog of time, but the day you had an auto accident earns a permanent etching in your memory.' Within the NMDA receptor are various subunits, and research, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, keeps pointing back to the GluN2B subunit as one of the most important. Knowledge: Infants and children have lots of GluN2B subunits, and as a result are like a sponge in soaking up memories and learning new things . Infants and children have lots of them, and as a result are like a sponge in soaking up memories and learning new things. But they gradually dwindle in number with age, and it also appears the ones that are left work less efficiently. She said: 'You can still learn new things and make new memories when you are older, but it's not as easy. 'Fewer messages get through, fewer connections get made, and your brain has to work harder.' Scientists have used a genetic therapy in laboratory mice, in which a virus helped carry complementary DNA into appropriate cells and restored some GluN2B subunits. Tests showed that it helped mice improve their memory and cognitive ability. Slowing the process: The best advice for maintaining cognitive function is to keep using your brain, and get physical exercise . However such gene therapy would probably be a last choice for humans, rather than a first option, as dietary or drug options would be explored first. Professor Magnusson said: 'Until more specific help is available, some of the best advice for maintaining cognitive function is to keep using your brain. 'Break old habits, do things different ways. Get physical exercise, maintain a good diet and ensure social interaction. 'Such activities help keep these subunits active and functioning. 'The one thing that does seem fairly clear is that cognitive decline is not inevitable, it's biological. 'We're finding out why it happens, and it appears there are ways we might be able to slow or stop it, perhaps repair the NMDA receptors. If we can determine how to do that without harm, we will.'\",\n",
       "  'As President Barack Obama channels his inner salesman to pitch military action in Syria, he shouldn\\'t be surprised when he finds a number of congressional doors already closed. One common refrain from those who plan to vote against the resolution to authorize military action in Syria is they simply can\\'t support a proposal that their constituents vociferously oppose. \"Both in terms of the percentage opposed -- I would have to say it is by far the single biggest issue we have seen,\" said Rep. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana. Daines represents all of Montana -- he is an \"at large\" member -- and he said that during the August recess he put 3,000 miles on his truck, crisscrossing the state and attending events that put him in close conversations with his constituents. At coffee hours, town halls, and meet and greets all over the state, Daines found that the sentiment was overwhelming: \"I am hearing from the people of Montana. They are telling me we should not be involved.\" \"It is called the people\\'s house for a reason,\" Daines concluded. \"We are here to express the voice of the people. This is an example of where Congress, hopefully, will express the will of the American people.\" The number of \"no\" votes in Congress continues to grow, while lawmakers planning to vote \"yes\" are becoming an even smaller minority, according to CNN\\'s latest vote count. There are currently 148 House members prepared to vote against Obama\\'s call for military action -- with 30 Democrats joining 118 Republicans in their opposition. That overall number of \"no\" votes has grown from 109 on Friday. In order to win passage of the authorization, Obama will have to persuade 270 members to vote \"yes\" -- a heavy lift, considering there are currently only 25 members who say they plan to vote \"yes\" on military action, 17 Democrats and eight Republicans. The number of \"yes\" votes has only increased by two since Friday. A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday shows that even though eight in 10 Americans believe that Bashar al-Assad\\'s regime gassed its own people, a strong majority don\\'t want Congress to pass a resolution authorizing a military strike against it. Since Obama unexpectedly asked Congress in August to authorize military action in Syria, polls have found that Americans are opposed to such action. The Senate has been more receptive than the House to Obama\\'s authorization request. There are currently 25 \"yes\" and 23 \"no\" votes in the Senate, with a significant 52 senators undecided. But the trend favors the \"no\" votes -- with a handful of moderate Democrats in the last three days coming out against the proposal. \"After doing my due diligence, I believe we need an alternative path forward in dealing with the Assad regime,\" said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota in a statement. \"We must balance the legitimate concerns that Americans have about the use of military force with our strategic interests.\" Other Democratic senators echoed Heitkamp: Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mark Begich of Alaska. Pryor issued a statement Saturday saying Obama and his national security team had not yet made an effective case for taking action against al-Assad\\'s regime and laying out the criteria that had to be met in order for him to support military action in Syria. \"Based on the information presented to me and the evidence I have gathered, I do not believe these criteria have been met,\" Pryor said. Begich told people on a telephone town hall last week that he was a \"probable no\" on Syrian authorization. \"This has probably been the No. 1 issue, especially in the last week, that Alaskans have been contacting my office, as well as when I was back home for the last month,\" Begich said. Because of the possibility of a filibuster, Obama and supporters need 60 votes in the Senate to win passage. Despite the vocal opposition and light support, majorities in both the House and Senate remain undecided on the proposal, and the White House is putting on the hard sell to court those possible \"yes\" votes. The Senate is expected to take up the resolution after returning from its month-long summer recess Monday. White House officials will travel to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to try to make their case with lawmakers, hours before Obama addresses the nation in a prime-time speech.',\n",
       "  'Washington (CNN) -- U.S. officials at the Pentagon and State Department denied Friday knowing of any efforts to take down the WikiLeaks website or asking companies to do so. The site\\'s efforts to publish 250,000 diplomatic cables has been hampered by denial-of-service attacks, ejection from its server host and cancellation of its name by its American domain name provider. Each time WikiLeaks has worked out other arrangements to bring the site back online. In written answers to readers\\' questions posted on the website of the British newspaper The Guardian, WikiLeaks\\' founder Julian Assange alleged \"abusive elements of the United States government\" were behind the site\\'s technical problems. A State Department spokesman disputed that the U.S. government was involved. \"I am not aware of any conversations by the United States government with either any internet host here or any government over there at this point,\" said spokesman P.J. Crowley. A Defense Department official also denied causing the technical problems slowing the WikiLeaks release of secret U.S. government documents. \"I am not aware that the Department of Defense is behind any of the problems that WikiLeaks is experiencing,\" Col. Dave Lapan, Pentagon spokesman, said Friday. \"We are not aware of what is causing the problems that WikiLeaks is experiencing.\" Lapan said the military\\'s Cyber Command has both defensive and offensive capabilities but is limited where and how it can operate. \"Cyber Command is to protect DoD networks,\" Lapan said at an off-camera question session with journalists. \"There are other agencies of the U.S. government that get involved in the commercial side. So there are certainly legal and other boundaries that would have to be considered.\" The Pentagon\\'s top spokesman, Geoff Morrell, said earlier this week that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates does not want to use the Pentagon\\'s online resources to go after WikiLeaks because the impact of the documents being published is not severe enough to warrant it. The United States is trying to track where WikiLeaks is publishing from, Crowley said. \"What we are doing is, we are tracking where these documents are emerging from. Just to keep track of what is being released and, as we have been doing for some time, trying to assess impact. So we are monitoring where documents are emerging from,\" Crowley told reporters Friday.',\n",
       "  '(CNN) -- There\\'s no question that losing your job can be a jolting experience, as anyone who has had the misfortune of being laid off in recent years can attest. But what if that jolt could be a positive experience? That\\'s the suggestion to come out of recent research which looked into the experiences of laid-off mid-to senior-level managers in the United States and Australia. The participants\\' overwhelming response was that the experience of losing their jobs in the previous 12 months had given them a renewed interest in living according to their values. The \"crisis\" of redundancy was in fact an opportunity to get to better know themselves, and reassess their priorities to lead more fulfilled, happier lives. \"All of the respondents, which surprised us, talked about the positives associated with this jolt of job loss,\" said study co-author Amy Kenworthy, a professor of management at Australia\\'s Bond University. \"These people took that jolt and focused on the positives of it to recalibrate themselves in terms of \\'Who am I and what do I want from life?\\' It was counter-intuitive with what we thought was going to take place.\" Read more: Want to be a leader? Act like one . Kenworthy said as their research was exploratory, and focused specifically on the experiences of those in middle-to upper-management, it did not necessarily represent everybody\\'s experiences. She said it reflected the way people could lose themselves and gradually become divorced from their personal values as they climbed the corporate ladder. Only a quarter of the responses from participants -- who ranged in age from their early 30s to late 50s, and nearly half of whom held doctorates -- related to feelings of self-doubt and cynicism, which the researchers had assumed would be the predominant response. \"It\\'s normal to be angry and upset and scared and frustrated, and to experience not only self-doubt, but cynicism about the process and the organization,\" said Kenworthy. Instead, the respondents expressed a desire to lead their lives with more \"authenticity\" and integrity, even if it meant forgoing corporate benefits or a high salary -- perhaps a luxury that former mid-to senior-level managers can afford. Their new priorities fit into three clear categories: the desire for a more balanced quality of life, with more time for family and friends; more meaningful work which they felt contributed to society; and job security and happiness. \"People said things like: \\'I didn\\'t realize how toxic work my environment was, and how important a criterion that should be\\',\" said co-author Suzanne de Janasz, professor of leadership and organization development at Swiss business school IMD. Said Kenworthy: \"All of them expressed a genuine desire to be true to oneself as they moved forward to the next chapter of their careers. It was everything from \\'I want to spend more time with my kids\\' to \\'I know I have much more creative talent than I was able to demonstrate in my last job.\\'\" Read more: Why we pick bad leaders . Two respondents had opted to write books following their redundancy. \"For many of us, at some level inertia takes over. It\\'s the comfort of the routine, the comfort of the expected. It\\'s hard to break out of that,\" said Kenworthy. \"The jolt of job loss may in fact be something that is very useful to people and there may be some very clear benefits to come from it.\" The authors said there were lessons for organizations from their research: that cutting back hours and salaries might be a mutually satisfactory way of getting through lean times, as it would allow employees to address their work-life balance. Where layoffs were unavoidable, organizations could offer affected employees workshops to help them to assess and prioritize their values, rather than simply update their resumes. More broadly, the findings were a useful reminder, as the times of economic uncertainty continued, that there was always a potential upside to a downturn. \"There is something we can take from the Chinese written language that they have understood for a very long time -- that crisis can mean opportunity,\" said Kenworthy. \"We don\\'t frame things that way, but maybe we should.\"',\n",

Six people were killed when a building being demolished collapsed Wednesday and nearly obliterated an adjacent Salvation Army thrift store, among the dead a woman who only recently got engaged, a young art student and a mother of nine. The mayor's office identified the victims as Anne Bryan, Roseline Conteh, Borbor Davis, Kimberly Finnegan, Juanita Harmin and Mary Simpson. The 13 people pulled alive from the rubble are Susan Randall, Betty Brown, Shirley Ball, Linda Bell, Jennifer Reynolds, Nadine White, Margarita Agosta, Richard Stasiorowski, Rosemary Kreutzberg, Rodney Geddis, Felicia Hill, Daniel Johnson and Myra Plekan. Wasteland: A four-story building being demolished collapsed Wednesday on the edge of downtown, killing six and injuring 13 people . Cleanup: A firefighter sprays the debris on Market Street in Philadelphia, which is all that was left from a building . ‘Our deepest condolences go out to the families and friends of the deceased,’ Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said during a press conference Tuesday. ‘I ask all Philadelphians to remember those who perished and their families in their prayers and thoughts.’ While city officials and the victims’ loved ones began picking up the pieces in the aftermath of the tragedy, new questions were being raised about the cause of the collapse. It was revealed Thursday that nearly a month before the deadly collapse that ended the lives of six people, the City of Philadelphia had been made aware of potentially unsafe demolition practices at the site. NBC Philadelphia reported that Center City resident Stephen Field, 49, called the municipal hotline on May 6 to express his concerns that the demolitions crew dismantling a building at 2134 Market Street used no safety equipment and had no protection for pedestrians. New beginning: Kimberly Finnegan, 35, just got engaged two weeks ago and was working her first day as a cashier at the downtown store when she was killed . Lives cut short: Borbor Davis, 68,\\xa0 (left), pictured with his wife, Maggie,\\xa0 died working at the Salvation Army store; Anne Bryan, 24, a first-year student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, was shopping at the store when the building came down . In memory: A reporter makes a photograph of a makeshift memorial for Kimberly J. Finnegan near the scene of a building collapse . 'There was nothing resembling efforts to prevent people walking by from being hit with brick,' he told the station. Licensing & inspection data shows contractor Griffin Campbell Construction was handing demolition at multiple adjacent properties along the 2100 block of Market Street, including house number 2136, which came crashing down on Wednesday. All three properties were either owned by or have ties to New York-based STB Investments. Field said that after some back-and-forth with a city representative, he was notified that an inspector visited the site in question and found no safety violations. At a press conference Thursday morning, Philadelphia Department of Licenses & Inspections Commissioner Carlton Williams said that 2136 Market Street was not inspected because demolition work had not begun at the time of Field's complaint. Loving mothers: Juanita Harmon, 75, a retired secretary, is survived by four grown sons; Roseline Coneth, 52, an immigrant from Sierra Leone who worked as a certified nursing assistant, was a mother of nine . The 49-year, however, insists that he witnessed crews doing demolition work on both sites before he called the helpline. In a press release this afternoon, Williams said that the city will now begin conducting 'proactive inspections' of all private demolitions. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter pledged a 'wide-ranging' investigation into the collapse. John Dougherty, head of Local 98 of the electrical workers' union, called the deadly collapse a 'sad metaphor' for the city's construction process, adding that his group had been concerned in recent years with similar demolition sites. The collapse of the building left six people dead, and in the hours after the tragic incident, their stories slowly began to emerge as their families struggled to come to terms with their loss. Anne Bryan, 24, was a first-year student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts who was described by teachers there as ‘dynamic, inquisitive and smart.’ Allegations: It was revealed that nearly a month before the deadly collapse that ended the lives of six people, the City of Philadelphia had been made aware of potentially unsafe demolition practices at the site . Official response: Mayor Michael Nutter, center, pledged a 'wide-ranging' investigation into the collapse . Philadelphia Department of Licenses & Inspections Commissioner Carlton Williams said that 2136 Market Street was not inspected last month because demolition work had not begun at the time . Her family called her a talented art student and generous friend, sister and daughter. ‘That she will not be here to continue to touch the lives of those around her is of intense pain to all of our family and her friends. This pain is fresh and it runs deep,’ the family said in a statement that asked for privacy. Bryan had been shopping at the thrift store when the edifice crumpled to the ground. Borbor Davis, 68, of Darby, was a Liberian immigrant who died working at the Salvation Army store. His stepdaughter called him a hardworking man and devoted husband. ‘He loved my mom so much,’ said Maryann M. Mason said, who said they'd been married several years. ‘They looked so good together.’ Davis’ wife, Maggie, told CBS Philadelphia that her husband called her just 15 minutes before the collapse. At 10.45am, she got a frantic call from her daughter telling her to turn on the TV. ‘I took out my phone right away and called him, he didn't answer me, and we had just put the phone down 15 minutes, so I call him again and I been calling him, he never answered,’ said Davis. The widow described her husband as a kind-hearted, Christian man who loved his job and never missed a day of work. Kimberly Finnegan, 35, of Philadelphia, was working her first day as a cashier at the downtown store after about a year at a Salvation Army shop in the city's Roxborough neighborhood, where she lived. She got engaged only two weeks ago, according to her brother, Bob Coleman. ‘The main thing, I think right now, is how incredibly happy she was,’ Coleman said. Juanita Harmon, 75, a retired secretary and a mother of four grown sons, loved to travel and shop, according to her family. Her son Andre said she would often go to the Salvation Army store to find him and his brothers special items.

'Certain people deserve certain things in life, and what she deserved she didn’t get,’ said friend Michael Morgan. Roseline Coneth, 52, an immigrant from Sierra Leone, worked as a certified nursing assistant, her loved ones told the station, adding that she came to the country to make their lives better. She was a mother of nine who enjoyed bargain-hunting - a hobby that brought her to the thrift store on Wednesday morning. Her grieving family are now planning to send her body back to her native West Africa for burial. So far, no information has been released on the sixth victim, Mary Simpson.\",\n",
       "  'Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- One year, 365 days and an endless number of seconds, transformed my life 360 degrees, made it go from color to black-and-white, turned laughter into tears. I now no longer perceive the world as a 14-year-old innocent girl who takes everything for granted, more as a victim of a terrible experience that\\'ll never fade away, always reminding me of what others go through and a memory that will forever stay with me. Before the revolution, I remember how, on cold winter nights we would sit together as a family, around the crackling fire sipping hot chocolate. I remember the smoke from the fireplace, wafting upward, leaving a scent of burning wood in the air. I remember looking into my sister\\'s eyes and that glimmer they always had, the smiles my parents would share. I remember how I used to love breaking the silence of the moment by rushing into my father\\'s lap, tracing the narrow path of velvet veins on his hand, as I enthusiastically told him about my day at school, my second home and my friends, my second family. We don\\'t live those days anymore. Now no one\\'s eyes can lie, and the only sound I can hear is the screaming of sorrow. March 23, 2011 was the first day I saw a demonstration in Syria. I was driving to a friend\\'s birthday party, through streets that were packed with people carrying flags and calling out chants in support of the regime. I was oblivious to my surroundings, I didn\\'t know what was going on. I thought it was just a demonstration that would blow over. \"Barely any one is coming! Their parents are too scared to send them because of what\\'s happening,\" my friend cried when she saw me. I looked into her eyes and saw the tears slowly forming and streaming down her red cheeks, streaking her dark make-up. As weeks passed by it kept getting worse. One day I jumped out of bed to the sound of something loud shattering the windows of my room. Breathless, I got up too quickly, barely noticing the glass sparkling on my dull rug. I ran but came to a sudden halt as I felt my head spinning and my vision darkening. My mom was crying and hugging my sister tightly. \"A bomb hit an area nearby,\" my mother stuttered, switching through the different news channels while trying to block us from seeing it. I managed to get a glimpse of it, on the TV, something I wish I had never seen. I remember my eyes feeling assaulted by the brightness on the screen, a sight that haunts me every night; dead bodies, bits of human flesh, were spread out like dispersed glass. I closed my eyes and opened them again, hoping I would go back to the life I was used to, where unicorns and rainbows existed along with Prince Charmings and forever afters. Unfortunately now, the dark days, and the nightmares take place on a regular basis, devastating my country and reluctant as I am to let it in, taking over my life, and controlling my mind. From then on the world changed for me. Instead of learning it slowly through experience it was taught to me harshly through the sound of gunshots and bombardments. I discovered how cruel life can be, and how in one second a smile can turn into a tear, peace into war, a friend into an enemy and life into death. I lived in a blur, not knowing what had happened or what I was to do. I woke up every morning to the sound of gunshots, bombs or the roaring helicopters accompanied by the sad news of the death or kidnapping of someone we knew. Some evenings, I hid under my blankets, covered my ears, and thought of the past trying to feel safe again. I silently peeked out my window to continuously stare at the moon in its different forms casting a dim light, to stare at the sky and the stars emerge taking their place in the night. The image drawing me further and further from reality, into the life I yearned to go back to. My parents tried to stay strong teaching us to do the same, until one night it all fell apart. I was sitting in my room, the place I hadn\\'t left for a long time, talking to my friend about our memories, and suddenly, I hear a cry, whispers, the sound of my mother\\'s sobs, then her yelling. \"I\\'m going out to find him!\" My family has its own business and my father was late coming back home, not answering his phone. \"But it\\'s too dangerous!\" my aunt screamed back at my mother. \"I don\\'t care!\" my mother shouted back. I ran down the spiraling staircase terrified, afraid of what was happening. Everything went black, like a starless night. I felt like the walls of the house were closing in, suffocating me. The background noise was blocked out and all I could do was stand and stare in dismay at my mom in this state for the first time. She lay on the stone courtyard just outside our front door, crying, holding her phone with a shivering hand dialing my dad\\'s number like her life depended on it. Everything stopped. It was like someone pressed the pause button in a movie, and now the seconds felt like hours. All I could hear was the pounding of my heart screaming over my mom\\'s voice. I don\\'t know how long we waited, or how fast my heart was beating, but when my dad\\'s car turned the corner, I gave everything I had left to run and hug him tighter than ever. At that moment my senses returned and I realized how cold the ground was under my bare feet. I carried my mom inside, and from that day on I learned that though she may be older, taller and more experienced, deep down she needs me just as much as I need her. Now, the one thing I looked forward to was waking up every morning and creeping into my parents\\' bedroom to look at my dad\\'s thin and frail face making sure he had made it in safe the night before. In school, only half my class was left. \"At least we have each other,\" said one of my five best friends with a comforting smile. However that didn\\'t last for long. Devastating news kept coming at us, beginning with the death of my friend\\'s uncle. \"In one second I lost my uncle; a part of me,\" she whispered in a heartbreaking tone. I looked at her hopelessly, trying to comfort her, but I knew no words could bring him back. Every morning for one month, no words were spoken by anyone besides the ones of regret. \"If we knew this was coming, we would have done things so differently,\" we would tell each other. We wouldn\\'t have taken so much for granted, we would have appreciated what we had. Instead it was ripped away. Grades dropped, smiles faded, students left, and all that remained were the memories that we would safely lock away. As my dad protectively drove us to and from school, the only places we could go to, I noticed the row of soldiers on the streets. They reminded me of domino pieces. Their presence radiated darkness. Each one had a solemn appearance, frightening eyes that looked right through you below their crunched frown. However, what always caught my eye were their large guns, the color of the dark pine trees they leaned on. I went from looking at colorful flowers and singing birds every morning, to dark killer weapons. April 5, 2012 was my last day of school. My parents decided to move us all to Lebanon. I had known it was coming all along. It wasn\\'t a surprise. Everyone was moving. I sank in my seat that day at school, buried my head into my hands and cried like I did every day. I remembered how when I heard the news about Egypt and the violence in Tahrir Square and thinking to myself that I was far from harm\\'s way. Now I was considering how hard it would be to move away from my home, my dad, my friends and family -- not knowing anyone or anything, possibly never being able to contact them because of the broken phone lines. My mind wandered back to 10 years ago when I first stepped foot into the school, only worrying about things like my friendship bracelets, and now I was expected to leave everything I ever knew behind. The people who knew me inside and out, who had carved a place in my heart. Memories flashed accompanied by more tears as my friends gathered around me and I opened my swollen eyes trying to picture the scene hoping it would last forever. I am angry and I feel hatred to the people that are ruining my country, anyone who is holding a gun and shooting no matter which side they\\'re on. Those who stole my childhood and that of so many others. My dream was to apply to universities with my friends as well as cry tears of joy when we threw our graduation hats in the air. Now that was crushed to pieces. One part of me, knows that this isn\\'t good bye, and that no matter where this crazy world takes us when the time is right we will return. Another part of me is scared that more people will die, even if they are not close to me. Everyone has a family, friends and they suffering. I am scared that I will lose the hope that I now have about being able to return, and being left with nothing but memories.',\n",

A Norwegian man plunged 1,000 feet to his death when his parachute failed to open after he struck a vertical cliff and spiraled out of control. Eiliv Ruud, 37 was taking part in a BASE jump near the Grand Canyon, but two other jumpers were forced to watch helplessly as the stunt went tragically wrong. BASE jumping is an activity in which participants leap off tall, static objects and use a parachute to break their fall. Scroll down for video . Fatal mistake: Eiliv Ruud, right of friend Nils Nielsen, plunged 1,000 feet to his death when his parachute failed to open after he struck a vertical cliff and spiraled out of control during a BASE jump . Tragic end: Friends of Mr Ruud who's pictured ice climbing, helplessly witnessed the horrific accident from above . Extreme sports: Ruud, an extreme sport enthusiast, is seen in at least one YouTube video while testing wingsuits with several others in 2010, this photo taken from one video and not confirmed to be him . The accident took place at Salt Trail Canyon, in northern Arizona, on Tuesday. The term 'BASE' is an acronym for 'buildings, antennas, spans and earth.' 'Mr. Ruud was the first one to jump, and the other two watched. When he had fallen a distance of about 500 feet, it appeared that a gust of wind blew him against the canyon wall,' said sheriff's spokesman Gerry Blair. Dare devils: A video that includes Mr Rudd base jumping in another incident shows how fast jumpers fall as well as from what daring heights . Death defying: Two people lean over the edge of a snow capped canyon before jumping off the side in specialized suits . Dizzying heights: A person wearing a wingsuit is captured by another participant above them while soaring down a canyon . Resting up: Some of Mr Ruud's friends, and possibly Mr Rudd in the far center himself, are seen resting at the top of a canyon . Daring: Mr Ruud took part in a BASE jump near the Grand Canyon, pictured, when he died . Mr Ruud's parachute failed to deploy fully, and the contact 'pretty much caused him to spiral down the rest' of the way, Mr Blair said. Mr Ruud was pronounced dead at the scene. Salt Trail Canyon flanks the Little Colorado River, one of the largest tributaries of the Colorado River that flows through the Grand Canyon. Mr Blair said Mr Ruud and the other Norwegian man and woman had previously visited the area, which is popular with BASE jumpers. Mr Blair said BASE jump fatalities in Coconino County were infrequent. Rescue crews were flown in and had to hike into the canyon to reach Mr Ruud, who was confirmed dead.\",\n",
       "  \"To call this XCOM would be a major disservice to one of the finest names in tactical gaming. For bar the well-realised time period, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is nothing but another generic third-person shooter with XCOM elements uncomfortably shoe-horned in. Set in the 1960s, you play Agent William Carter – the leader of a three-man squad sent to investigate various alien attacks. Negative space: Gamplay gets repetitive very quickly - despite 2K's best efforts in enemy variation . To its credit, the uninspired combat holds up well. Using a Mass Effect-style command and abilities wheel spliced with a Gears of War cover-system, battles often involve sending your teammates down the flanks to draw fire, while you attack from the other side. Each of your squaddies have their own abilities – for example the Engineer can deploy a floating turret and the Sniper has a useful Critical shot. But where it falls down is in its implementation of a key XCOM principle – that being; when a character dies, they stay dead. Although your squad mates can die if not revived, main character Carter cannot – his fatality merely causing a respawn of the entire squad at the previous checkpoint. Thus, throughout the game’s 15-hour campaign, you never feel connected to the character in the same way you were your squad in XCOM: Enemy Unknown. There's no sense of urgency because you know a checkpoint is always there to save you. Sure, it’s slightly annoying when a high-level squadmate is downed, but they all have no personality or character – and are replaced by yet another bot from a limitless supply of AI-controlled drones. Weapons, too, have no wow factor. All seem slightly muted, with even the largest alien guns coming across as completely limp. Another element uncomfortably borrowed from Enemy Unknown is player choice, and it's commendable that The Bureau – given its frequent delays in development – has kept this element in. However, choices are too black and white often not presenting a moral dilemma but a clear cut: be nice, be nasty scenario. Wooden voice acting and average lip synching do the dialogue sections no favours, either. You can even run around The Bureau's HQ - but apart from the odd mini-game, it's incredibly dull. Boring: There are some nice touches but for the most part there's little to make The Bureau stand out . But by far the biggest nail in The Bureau’s coffin is the lack of co-operative multiplayer. In sticking so rigidly to the rules of the XCOM universe (that being, once your teammates die, they die), they’ve missed a golden opportunity to lift this game away from average. But even then, thrills would be predictable and offer nothing other titles – for example Gears of War – do better. The Bureau isn’t a bad game. It’s just average. And in this day and age, that can be the kiss of death. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is out now. Let us know what you think on Twitter: @DailyMailGames and on Facebook: Daily Mail Games.\",\n",
       "  'At two years old, Samuel Dymott is too young to realise just how incredibly dear he is to his parents. He knows they love him. But it will be some time before he comprehends just how much money – and heartache – they invested during the four years they spent trying to have him. His mother Jo Sharpe had been told by an NHS specialist she would never conceive with her own eggs after blood tests showed she was perimenopausal, meaning she was heading for early menopause. Happy mum:\\xa0Jo Sharpe, 38, and her husband Miles Dymott, 42, from Brighton, had son Samuel, pictured aged six months, after several rounds of IVF and alternative treatments costing £60,000 . But after she endured two failed rounds of IVF at a private clinic, and countless alternative therapies, Samuel was finally conceived after a third round of IVF. By then his parents had spent more than £60,000 ensuring his arrival. He was born on March 26, 2012, weighing 9lb 3oz. Their struggle to become parents has left Miss Sharpe, a recruitment manager, and her husband Miles Dymott, an IT manager, around £20,000 in debt. But Samuel is worth every penny to them. Miss Sharpe, 38, said: ‘Every day I think how lucky I am to have had my own biological child. It’s such a massive thing for me.’ The couple, from Brighton, began trying for a baby soon after marrying. Mr Dymott has a daughter, Aisha, now 13, from a previous relationship but they wanted a child together too. Price for joy: Samuel, pictured recently, was finally conceived after a third round of IVF, leaving Ms Sharpe, and Mr Dymott around £20,000 in debt . If the woman is under 35, doctors usually tell couples they cannot have tests until they have tried for 12 months without success to become pregnant. But after only three months Miss Sharpe, who was 32 at the time, and her husband went to their GP in 2008. ‘I lied and said we’d been trying for a year,’ she said. It was then that blood tests showed she was heading for early menopause and her only hope was donor eggs or adoption. But she refused to give up hope and threw herself into researching fertility. After making appointments with a private fertility clinic and a Chinese medicine practitioner, she replaced alcohol, sugar, caffeine and carbohydrates with wheatgrass shots and maca powder, a supplement made from a South African root which is purported to boost energy. She also tried acupuncture, reflexology, yoga and pilates. Then came the two unsuccessful rounds of IVF, using her eggs and her husband’s sperm, both in 2009. Failing to become pregnant was heartbreaking, but Miss Sharpe was determined to try again and found a clinic in London with a different – and more expensive – approach involving more extensive tests. She had to get up at 4.45am to travel to London for daily blood tests before heading back to work, and had 14 days of hormone injections before two embryos were put back into her womb. The day before she was due to have a pregnancy blood test at the clinic, her husband, now 42, convinced her to take a home pregnancy test. ‘I was too nervous to look at it so I handed it to Miles. When his face lit up I knew it was positive,’ she said. As for the alternative therapies, she is sceptical about how much they helped her to conceive, but says they gave her a psychological boost. She also ordered the controversial drug DHEA, a hormone supplement which is thought to boost oestrogen levels, off the internet, but says it gave her boils on her face, chest and back. The couple used bonuses, overdrafts and credit cards, plus help from her parents, to pay for the ever rising cost of having Samuel. Since his birth, they have tried for another child and Miss Sharpe has had two more rounds of IVF, costing £10,000 each, boosting their pregnancy bill to a total of £83,200.',\n",

A builder who whistled in the face of police officers during a Hong Kong protest march was today jailed for six weeks. Ki Chun-kei insisted that the whistling was nothing more than drunken antics, and claimed he did not know the policemen were so close when he did it. But one of the officers claimed he had become deaf for three seconds thanks to the whistling, leading the judge to impose a prison sentence on the demonstrator. Jailed: Ki Chun-kei has been sentenced to six weeks in prison for whistling at police officers during a protest . Ki, 50, was participating in an annual demonstration on July 1 last year to mark the anniversary of Hong Kong being handed over to China by the UK, the\\xa0South China Morning Post reported. He was caught on camera approaching police and whistling at them, apparently without immediate provocation. One officer said Ki was less than a foot away from his ear when he whistled sharply, leaving him unable to hear for two or three seconds. The defendant's lawyer Pauline Leung Po-lam said that he had not meant to harm the policemen, and argued that 'a short ringing in their ears' did not amount to assault. But magistrate Ho Wai-yang disagreed, pointing out that the officers were clearly identifiable thanks to their uniforms, and characterised the incident as an 'illegal use of force'. Caught on camera: The defendant apparently made an officer deaf for around three seconds . Ki was found guilty in January of three charges of assaulting police. 'Every Hongkonger has the right to take part in protests,' Ms Ho said at the time. 'The court respects that. But the court does not allow the illegal use of force.' During sentencing today, the magistrate ruled that Ki should spend six weeks in prison for the three assaults. She said she was taking into account two similar offences committed by the defendant more than a decade ago. Defence: Ki, a builder, insisted he did not mean to harm the officers during the July 1 demonstration . Ms Po-Lam said that a doctors' report showed that Ki was an alcoholic, which could have impaired his decision-making. 'The offence was not made after detailed planning,' she said. 'He had perhaps become impulsive after drinking.' While Hong Kong is a partial democracy which is generally considered much more free than mainland China, many campaigners have complained of a crackdown on civil liberties and human rights in the territory.\",\n",
       "  \"By . Steph Cockroft . The stopped watch, pipe and other last possessions of a First World War hero have gone on display 99 years after his death. The belongings of 36-year-old Harold Llewellyn Twite include his mud-encrusted watch which was stopped at 8pm on 1 December 1915 - the exact moment he was killed by a German mine in the Somme region, northern France. But the objects, covered in the mud from the tunnels in which Lieutenant Twite died, were only discovered 99 years later because his heartbroken widow Lucy Muriel Twite was too distressed to look at them. The watch worn by Lieutenant Twite was frozen at 8pm on 1 December 1915, the exact moment he was killed by a German mine. The watch lay untouched for 99 years after his widow was too heartbroken to look at it . His grandson David Chilcott found the sacred items just this year and has donated them to the St Agnes Museum in Cornwall, in Lieutenant Twite's home village. After his death, Lieutenant Twite's surviving comrades scoured the French frontline where he fought to gather his kit bag, letters, binoculars and other belongings. Harold Llewellyn Twite, who was killed on 1 December 1915, aged 36, by a German mine . They then posted them back to Sutton, Surrey, where Lieutenant Twite's family was living at the time. But his widow could not bear to open the parcel and his daughter had just a brief look before it was packed away. The mementos then lay untouched, covered in the mud from the Somme tunnels in which he had battled, for nearly a century. It was then only this year that Lieutenant Twite's grandson David Chilcott, also from Cornwall, stumbled across them. Lieutenant Twite was working overseas as a mining engineer when war was declared. He returned home to sign up and was seconded to the 183rd (Tunnelling) Company of the Royal Engineers. An expert in digging tunnels and sinking shafts, Lieutenant Twite was put in charge of a team of Cornish miners. The team's job was to tunnel under the German trenches in northern France to lay explosives. His team had just retreated in December 1915, after setting a series of charges, when the enemy detonated a huge mine. The blast killed him and four of his fellow countrymen. After Lieutenant Twite's death fighting in the Somme region of northern France, his pipe and binoculars were sent back to his widow, who was living in Sutton, Surrey at the time, by his comrades . They are buried in Citadel New Military Cemetery at Fricourt, a village on the Somme, near Albert. Lieutenant Twite's widow commissioned a memorial plaque in her local church to honour her husband and his dead comrades. She also wrote to their families to pay her respects. When the items were found, Mr Chilcott donated them . to the St Agnes Museum where they will feature as part of a memorial . exhibition, marking the Great War's centenary. Museum spokeswoman Liz Thompson said the personal nature of the items offered a tangible reminder of the terrible loss suffered by soldiers' families. A page from the sketch book of another unnamed First World War hero, which is also on display at the exhibition . These sketches from the First World War, taken from an unknown person's sketchbook, will also be on display at the exhibition . She said: 'His widow never opened it, . his daughter looked at it once, and his grandson, David Chilcott, . generously offered it to us. We were amazed when David brought it in. 'Among the possessions are his shirt, pipe and mud-encrusted watch, stopped at precisely 8pm, the time of his death. 'There is a letter to his widow, written by a fellow officer from the battlefield, and a great deal of correspondence.' The exhibition will also include a sketch pad containing drawings from an unknown artist. In late 1914, it became clear that new tactics were needed for both sides to break through the enemy's entrenched positions. So the British Army employed companies of engineers to start digging attacking tunnels under the enemy lines. Tunnelling would involve digging under the enemy lines, placing explosives in the tunnels and blowing them up. Once a tunnel was discovered, it would be destroyed by the enemy. For the infantry above ground, the wait . for underground explosions was nerve-wracking. For the men underground, the explosions often meant sudden death. It became a good way of moving into an enemy territory. But there was a constant struggle to . find the areas where the conditions were most favourable - and to rebuild in areas which had been targetted by the enemy. As the two sides created tunnels and counter tunnels, there were many underground encounters. Sometimes . a tunnelling team would break into an enemy position and meet the . enemy underground. This would lead to fighting in the tunnels.\",\n",
       "  \"To the trained eye, this 'penguin' is clearly a machine - but that hasn't stopped it fooling and infiltrating a large group of notoriously shy emperor penguins. Biologists are using the penguin rover to approach the group and learn more about their feeding habits, health, and interactions. And it is so convincing, penguins in the group were spotted talking to it, as if it was a potential mate for their chicks. Scroll down for video . Scientists have created a remote control rover (pictured), disguised as an emperor penguin chick. The device was designed to snuggle up to shy penguins and track their health. The baby penguin robotic spy lets scientists check heart rate, stress levels and other penguin parameters . Emperor penguins are difficult to study because they are shy and easily intimidated. When researchers approach, these penguins typically back away and the stress of the encounter causes their heart rates to increase. Emperors are the largest species of penguins, and an average bird grows to almost 4ft (1.1 metres) tall. LIke all penguins, the animals can't fly. Emperors live on the Antarctic ice and have developed so-called cooperative behaviours to handle the harsh winds and low temperatures. For example, the birds huddle together to protect themselves from the wind and conserve energy. Individuals take turns moving into the centre of the group, before moving to the outside when it has warmed up. Females lay a single egg before leaving the male to look after it as she goes hunting. At sea, emperor penguins can dive to 1,850 feet (565 meters) for krill and other fish - and can stay underwater for more than 20 minutes. Mothers can be away for up to two months, and when they return they regurgitate the food into the newly hatched chicks' mouths. The males then go hunting. To monitor the birds' health, without causing them unnecessary stress, a group of scientists and filmmakers, led by Yvon Le Maho from the University of Strasbourg in France, created the remote-controlled rover, disguised as a chick. The penguins themselves were fitted with heart-rate loggers. The experiment took place in Adelie Land, Antarctica - the same place where the 2005 documentary 'March of the Penguins' was filmed. After sending the rover into the group, researchers watched from a distance of 650 feet (198 metres) away. The first disguised version of the rover, made of fiberglass, scared the real birds, Professor Le Maho said. In total, the researchers experimented with five more versions of the rover before finding a design that worked. The rover is covered in grey fur, has black arms and a black-and-white painted face, plus a black beak. It is fitted with cameras and sensors that connect to the researchers' computers. The penguins didn't scamper away and even sang to it with 'a very special song like a trumpet,' Professor Le Maho said. Professor Le Maho suggested that the adult penguins were trying to find a mate for their chicks and they were listening for a response, but researchers didn't program the rover to make a sound.

Researcher Yvon Le Maho (pictured) tried five versions of robotic penguins during tests . 'They were very disappointed when there was no answer,' he said. 'Next time we will have a rover playing songs.' At other times, the rover crowded in with a group of chicks, acting as 'a spy in the huddle,' Professor Le Maho continued. Researchers worry that just by coming close to some shy animals they change their behavior and can taint the results of their studies. A number of rovers are being used, and a similar model was seen in the BBC series Spy In The Huddle. Professor Le Maho also used a rover without any animal disguise to spy on king penguins and elephant seals, because those animals don't flee strangers. The king penguins attacked the small rover with their beaks, unless it stayed still, but even that allowed the device to get close enough to get readings. The large  elephant seals didn't budge when the rover zipped by and around them. In the future, the researchers plan to use a more autonomous robot to spy on the emperor penguins. The idea is to use devices on the rover to read signals from radio tags on the birds. The study is published in the journal Nature Methods. Experts also used a rover without any disguise to spy on king penguins and elephant seals. The undisguised rover is shown approaching an incubating king penguin (top left), that has been fitted with a heart rate (HR) logger. Chart (b) shows the increase in heart rate when the rover, and the human, approaches the birds .\",\n",
       "  \"By . Spencer Matthews . So I’m single again. I’ve split up with Stephanie Pratt, whom I had been dating for about four months. The reason for the split is largely down to the fact that we moved far too fast from the dating stage to the living-together stage. This was partly because Steph is from Los Angeles and I didn't want her to incur the huge costs of living out of hotels in London, but clearly there was an emotional cost to moving in together so quickly, which was that it made our relationship far too claustrophobic. Over: Spencer Matthews explains why he and Stephanie Pratt broke up after dating for four months . Whenever any girlfriend comes into a tight group of friends it’s difficult but when they have practically no shared experiences or associations it’s almost impossible for the relationship to thrive – and that is what started to happen with me and Stephanie. Perhaps if it wasn’t for the cabin fever we suffered in my apartment in Chelsea the relationship might have endured, after all Stephanie is stunning, classy, witty, clever and has a great sense of style – even if it was utilised to veto several of the items of clothing in my wardrobe (see previous weeks’ blogs). Too much, too soon: 'There was an emotional cost to moving in together so quickly, which was that it made our relationship far too claustrophobic,' explains Spennie . And although viewers of Made in Chelsea may not have seen this side of her towards me on yesterday’s E4 show she is also warm, caring and affectionate, and I do hope we can remain friends. The boys seemed to receive the news of my split with a stunned silence (or fear) and there was a trademark Made In Chelsea pause when I made the announcement at dinner. One plus point from the dinner was that even Andy was forced to admit of me, 'I don’t love the guy but you can’t fault him, he always wears a nice suit.' Striking: Ever the style chameleon, Spencer showcases his fashion credentials in a mustard jacket on Monday's show . Cleaning up: Stephanie finds offensive jacket in Spencer's wardrobe, which goes straight in charity shop pile . My mustard coloured suit was certainly a bit of a departure from the rather more sober slate grey numbers the other boys were wearing on the night and before we sat for dinner, we said a quick Latin grace: Benedictus, Benedicat per Jesum Christum Dominum Nostrum. All the Eton boys (Proudlock. Stevie and I) know this well as it is said at every meal at school. It roughly translates to, 'May he who is Blessed bless [this food] through Jesus Christ Our Lord.' And I know another wise religious passage as well, 'let he who is without sin cast the first stone.' So let’s not judge others (and by others I mean me) too harshly. All the best, Spencer xxx .\",\n",

A member of the public came across the gruesome find on sand dunes at Tallow Beach around 11.20am and told police immediately. Police responding to the discovery said there were no initial clues about how the woman, believed to be aged in her 20s or 30s, died. Her death was later confirmed as not suspicious. Crime scene: A woman - whose identity remains unknown - was found dead on Tallow Beach in Byron Bay around 11.30am on Monday. At this stage her identity and exact age have not been disclosed by police. Forensics officers examined the scene early this afternoon, however details about the woman's death remain sketchy. 'We just can't say one way or another,' a NSW police spokesman said. 'There's nothing obvious either way.' A post mortem will be performed and a crime scene has been set up at the beach. A senior Tweed Heads police officer told MailOnline the woman's body was clothed when it was discovered. Gruesome: A woman's body was found by a member of the public on Monday morning. Details of her death remain sketchy and police are yet to determine her age or even her identit . She said police estimated her severely-decomposed body had been in the location for three to five days. Earlier this year the bodies of Greg Hutchings and his daughter Eeva Dorendahl were discovered in dunes in nearby Pottsville, on the NSW far north coast, after an apparent abduction. Hutchings and his estranged wife were locked in custody battle over their daughter. Hot spot: The area around Tallow beach is a popular tourist destination for Australian and international travelers . Detectives have begun interviewing nearby business owners - including the manager of the Suffolk Beachfront holiday park near where the body was found. A large police present remained at the beach well into the afternoon. A staffer at the establishment said the body was found near Gaggin Park, on the southern end of Tallow beach. Tallow Beach is a popular tourist destination for Australian and international travelers and a number of holiday parks litter the coastline. Her death was not suspicious, police said.

       "  'Washington (CNN) -- Republican vice-presidential hopeful and conservative star Paul Ryan kicks back with locally brewed beers while listening to \\'90s-era grunge music. He\\'s the first member of Generation X to be named to a major party ticket. Ryan\\'s up-by-your-bootstraps personality doesn\\'t exactly match the ennui expressed by the grunge bands of his youth -- he was voted \"biggest brown-noser\" in high school, after all. But his economic and political perspectives, like those of many of his generation, were formed in part by the fiscally conservative Reaganomics principles of his childhood and the stark realities of entering a post-college job market during the 1990s recession and dot-com boom and bust. \"Gen Xers were supposed to be the lost generation. (That label) shaped him because he went back to the principles of hard work to get ahead,\" said Dylan Glenn, a former Bush administration economic policy analyst who has been friends with Ryan for nearly 20 years. In his pairing with baby boomer Mitt Romney, the 42-year-old Ryan brings a conservative Gen Xer\\'s fiscal approach to the ticket, political experts say. For example, Ryan\\'s controversial \"Path to Prosperity\" entitlement reform plan, which proposes a partially privatized Medicare program for future seniors, takes a cue from Gen X and Gen Y concerns that these programs will run out of funds long before Xers and Yers will be able to participate. \"There are plenty of young people who do not believe Medicare and Social Security are going to be there, and that\\'s part of the logic why Paul Ryan is trying to reform these things and make sure they are available for future generations,\" said Soren Dayton, communications director for the Young Republican National Federation. Ryan\\'s conservative stance extends beyond fiscal policy . It is a proposal that Romney has not fully embraced. His campaign told surrogates in a talking points memo obtained by CNN on Saturday: \"Gov. Romney applauds Paul Ryan for going in the right direction with his budget, and as president he will be putting together his own plan for cutting the deficit and putting the budget on a path to balance.\" Still, Ryan\\'s history-making ascension to the ticket does suggest that the GOP is turning a page in leadership. \"This is a young generation of leadership coming forward,\" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta who has studied post-civil rights era politicians. Passing the torch requires that both generations of the party\\'s leadership agree to disagree on social policy, she said. \"A lot of young Republicans don\\'t agree with the party on a lot of social issues so they emphasize the fiscal stuff,\" Gillespie said. Ryan opposes same-sex marriage and, as a devout Roman Catholic, once described himself as \"pro-life as a person gets.\" However, in 2007, he voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, banning workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation. A Pew Research Poll conducted last month of nearly 3,000 adults found that support for allowing same-sex marriage has increased among Generation X from 44% in 2008 to 52% this year. \"Paul Ryan is a bridge between, generationally speaking,\" said Amy Holmes, anchor of GBTV\\'s \"Real News\" at the Blaze, a conservative news site owned by Glenn Beck. Ryan \"voted for banning workplace discrimination based on sexual discrimination. That\\'s a reflection in part of the Gen X sensibility. We\\'ve grown up with gay men and women being out of the closet. ... It\\'s not as shocking as it is for boomers.\" Ryan\\'s college years . Ryan\\'s tepid support for environmental programs also seems to dovetail with Gen Xers\\' views on the matter. According to a recent University of Michigan Institute for Social Research survey of 3,000 adults, just 5% of Gen Xers said they are \"alarmed\" and 18% said they are \"concerned\" about climate change. Most of the group surveyed last year, or 66%, said they\\'re unsure if global warming is happening, and 10% said they don\\'t believe it\\'s occurring. Those generational differences could help sway voters turned off by the GOP\\'s messaging on social issues such as abortion, but who are open to Republican stances on necessary budget cuts. Then there\\'s the visual appeal of Ryan, who is the same age as one of Romney\\'s sons. When Ryan stands on stage, flanked by his young children and wife, next to the Romneys, the older man looks warmer and more paternal, Gillespie said. \"Mitt Romney is extremely stiff ... because he still has this persona where it hard for him to feel relatable. To have someone who is young and dynamic helps soften Romney up and attracts that \\'it\\' factor and \\'wow\\' factor,\" Gillespie said. \"Paul Ryan would seem to be cooler. Even talking about the fact that he listens to Led Zeppelin and grunge. ... The fact that he says he likes hard rock makes him seem cooler. ... That charisma is born in youth.\" What do you think of Romney naming Ryan as his running mate? Let us know on CNN iReport.',\n",

How . much of that was down to Steve Von Bergen’s departure after just eight . minutes with a suspected fractured cheekbone is open to speculation. What is clear is that after he was forced off to hospital, following a . brutal connection with Giroud’s high boot, Switzerland developed more . holes than one of their famous cheeses. New . Aston Villa defender Philippe Senderos arrived to join his ex-Arsenal . team-mate Johan Djourou and both showed why they are no longer in Arsene . Wenger’s ranks.

It was stunning stuff. Benzema . progress his golden boot chances by scoring midway through the second . half. Paul Pogba, on as a substitute, sliced a lovely ball forward, . Senderos hacked horribly and Benzema fired in his ninth goal in nine . internationals. Body behind it: Benaglio got his whole torso behind the spot kick to avoid going down 3-0, momentarilly . Blood bin: Defender Steve von Bergen (left) goes off bleeding from a wound near his eye . Nightmare start: Von Bergen goes down in the opening minutes of the group E clash after a collision . Piggy-back to last-16?: Mathieu Valbuena (left) jumps on Giroud after extending the lead to 3-0 . Put away: Valbuena latched onto a low cross from Giroud following a slick counter-attack . Gratefully received: Benaglio scrambles but has no chance as France's lead becomes a mountain for the Swiss . On the money: Benzema scored France's fourth with this finish between Benaglio's legs . Another . lovely move 20 minutes from time made it five. Benzema fed Sissoko, . whose first time hit across goal whistled in. Saves from Benaglio and . last-ditch clearances prevented an even bigger rout and Switzerland got . two of their own late on as the French switched off. Nine . minutes from time Blerim Dzemaili fired a low free-kick through a . pathetic French wall to defeat Lloris and then Granit Xhaka got another . back with a superb volley.

       "  '(CNN) -- Funerals in Ghana are not only an occasion to mourn. They are also an opportunity to celebrate the life of the dearly departed. Hardly ever a somber, low-key affair, Ghanaian funerals are a social event attended by a large number of mourners, which could reach hundreds -- the more, the better. \"That means the person was very friendly, very charitable, was good to socialize, was having a good communication with the people within the society,\" says Jamima, a family friend who attends the funeral of the 70-year-old Joanna Boafo in the town of Kumasi. Ghanaians may spend as much money on funerals as on weddings, sometimes even more. \"An average funeral should cost between $15,000-$20,000,\" says Kwaku, a funeral planner who is in charge of 30 funeral parties on this one day alone. That includes the obligatory giant, colorful billboards that announce funeral arrangements. The billboards, which may cost from nearly $600 to $3,000, are placed at strategic spots for everybody to see, often dotting the cities\\' skylines. Most funerals are held on the weekends, most frequently on Saturdays. Mourners, usually dressed in black or black and red traditional funeral clothing, may travel to other towns or villages, and in turn they expect the bereaved families to provide food, drinks, music and dance. The extravagance also extends to the caskets. Coffins have become a statement in Ghana. They are usually brightly colored and elaborate. They may have fanciful shapes that resemble the dead\\'s favorite objects, or represent their profession. Thus, a carpenter may have a coffin shaped like a hammer, or a shoe for a shoemaker. There are also caskets shaped like Coca-Cola bottles and airplanes. Ghanaians revere the dead so much that funerals are at the heart of Ghanaians\\' social life. Lavish spending on funerals has invited criticism from political and religious leaders. \"We are investing in the dead rather than the living ... and that is bad,\" legislator Alban Bagbin once said. Charles Gabriel Palmer-Buckle, the Archbishop of Accra, said: \"The surest way to remember the dead is not the type of coffins used to bury them nor is not the type of cloth or T-shirt won during their funerals, but doing something positive for the dead which would benefit the living.\" Funeral rites also involve some official crying by mourners, as well as praying. The Boafos, like many grieving Ghanaian families, hold a church service for Joanna as well. But the rest of the funeral ritual is purely party time. \"I think she would be very happy,\" says Richard, son of Joanna, as mourners are dancing and having a good time. \"I think if she is anywhere, if my mother is anywhere right now, she will be very happy.\" See also: Ghana: Keeping one of Africa\\'s stars of democracy shining .

       "  '(CNN)A young mother in Washington state has been charged with attempted murder after authorities say she cut her children\\'s throats in an attempt to keep them quiet. Over the weekend, Christina Booth called 911 to report that her three children were crying nonstop and \"needed medical attention,\" according to a recent probable cause filing. The 28-year-old and her husband, Thomas Booth, have three children, a 2-year-old and 6-month-old twins. When officers arrived at the Olympia, Washington, home Saturday night, they found a troubling scene. As spelled out by a local prosecutor, police saw the twins on the couch crying \"uncontrollably\" and \"bleeding from their necks.\" One officer then went upstairs and found the couple\\'s 2-year-old in bed, under the covers with \"dry blood all over her.\" All three were taken to a local hospital, where, CNN affiliate KOMO reports, they underwent surgery. They are now in stable condition and will be placed in protective custody. In their probable cause filing, authorities paint a picture of a mother overwhelmed and suffering from postpartum depression. A judge set bail for Booth at $3 million, KCPQ, another CNN affiliate, reported. The night that ended in tears and blood began with wine and a movie. In the probable cause filing, Thomas Booth told investigators he had two \"large glasses\" and his wife had at least the same amount. \"Thomas said he was feeling intoxicated,\" the document reads \"and Christina was intoxicated to the point that she was slurring her words.\" As the movie wrapped up, Thomas Booth told police, his wife took the toddler upstairs to put her to bed, but then \"a short time later Christina came down the stairs in only her underwear crying and screaming.\" Postpartum depression: One mom\\'s mission becomes a movement . Christina Booth, like her husband, spoke to authorities without an attorney present. Her story differs from her husband\\'s slightly, a local prosecutor said. She told a police detective that she was having \"a really rough time\" taking care of her three children. She said that her husband \"never helps\" and that he \"gets very annoyed when the children cry and make noise.\" Like her husband, Christina Booth said they were watching a movie and she went to put the toddler to bed just before the movie ended. She then told authorities that the twins started crying and \"she hit her breaking point.\" In the probable cause document, a prosecutor says she confessed to the crimes of which she stands accused, saying \"she knew if she killed all the kids the house would be quiet for Thomas.\" \"During the interview, Christina broke down crying several times, yelled about Thomas never helping with the kids\" the document says. \"Christina made the comment \\'they will be quiet now\\' several times.\" Thomas Booth told police that his wife has been \"very stressed out raising the children\" and that she took medication for postpartum depression. He also said she \"always takes the children out of his presence if they cry.\" The couple\\'s account differs in where the attack on the twins took place. Christina Booth told authorities she carried them downstairs after attacking her toddler and cut their necks while they lay on the couch. Her husband told police he found the babies upstairs with injuries to their necks and brought them downstairs to render first aid. Thomas Booth has not been charged, and KOMO reports that police do not suspect he played any kind of role in the violence.

Neighbor Tammy Ramsey expressed concern to KOMO about the potential for missed opportunities to help the family. \"Why weren\\'t we knocking on the door?\" she said. \"I think that we need to rally and love to understand and not to judge.\"',\n",
       "  '(CNN Student News) -- April 13, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today\\'s show: . • Japan • Chernobyl • Washington, D.C. Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: To our Facebook fans in Kansas, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania and to everyone who\\'s watching us around the world, welcome to CNN Student News. From the CNN Center in Atlanta, Georgia, I\\'m Carl Azuz. First Up: Japan Nuclear Crisis . AZUZ: First up, Japan\\'s prime minister wants some answers from the company that runs the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Specifically, the prime minister wants to know when the crisis at the plant is going to be over. He\\'s looking for a timetable from the Tokyo Electric Power Company, and he says one should be coming soon. He\\'s also promised to get this crisis under control \"at all costs.\" In the meantime, the Japanese government has classified the situation at the Fukushima plant as a level 7. That means it is among the most serious nuclear accidents ever. That rating is based on how much radiation has been released from the plant, and it means officials expect long-term efforts to deal with all the issues caused by this accident. Thousands of people have had to leave the region around the plant. The prime minister promised to help them find jobs, housing and education. What\\'s happening in Japan has some people remembering another nuclear accident that took place nearly 25 years ago. It was a meltdown at Chernobyl nuclear plant in the former Soviet Union. Diana Magnay looks at the long-lasting effects of the worst nuclear accident in history. (BEGIN VIDEO) DIANA MAGNAY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We\\'re driving through the exclusion zone en route to Chernobyl. It doesn\\'t feel like a place where the world\\'s worst-ever nuclear accident happened almost 25 years ago. The sun lends a wintry charm to the derelict homes we passed. In all, nearly 350,000 people were forced to abandon their homes as a radioactive cloud blew over Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. This village is called Zalissya in Ukrainian, which literally means \"behind the forest.\" But as you can see now, it has been completely consumed by the forest. And when the villages were evacuated about ten days after the accident took place, they thought that they\\'d be able to come back here, that this village would be inhabitable again. But as you can see, that wasn\\'t to be the case. So, this is the memorial. How many people died immediately after the accident? YURI TATARCHUK, CHERNOBYL GUIDE: Answer, about 30 people in one month died overall. Highly radiated. MAGNAY: Yuri Tatarchuk, who\\'s our certified guide from Ukraine\\'s ministry of emergencies, says the final death toll from the nuclear fallout is impossible to calculate, but that it\\'s less than people feared. Estimates from the International Atomic Energy Agency put the number at 4,000. But the World Health Organization points to 4,000 incidents of thyroid cancer among children from the affected areas. TATARCHUK: So now, it\\'s 8.7, 9 microsieverts. MAGNAY: Radiation\\'s not down to normal, but Tatarchuk says it\\'s not a health risk if you\\'re just here for the day. TATARCHUK: We\\'re staying here just minutes, but it\\'s not so sure if such levels of radiation inhabiting here is not allowed. MAGNAY: We\\'re not the only visitors. A Russian tour group picked their way through frozen tower blocks in nearby Pripyat. The town was evacuated the day after reactor number four exploded, before the Soviet Union admitted it had a serious problem in one of its nuclear plants. This year, the government will remove restrictions to the exclusion zone, turning these Soviet ghost towns into a tourist destination, a chance for people to see for themselves the relics of a nuclear catastrophe frozen in time. Diana Magnay, CNN, Pripyat, Ukraine. (END VIDEO) What\\'s the Word . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What\\'s the word? When a government spends more money than it takes in, the difference is called a _____? DEFICIT . That\\'s the word! Budget Battle . AZUZ: In March, the U.S. federal deficit was $188 billion. President Obama and Congress are looking at ways to reduce that deficit. Republicans laid out some ideas last week. The president is scheduled to outline his plan in a speech later today. In more immediate budget news, though, we\\'re getting some details about the spending cuts that could be voted on this week. This is part of the deal that helped avoid the government shutdown last week. $38.5 billion in cuts would affect programs from the Transportation, Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services departments. Of course, Congress has to pass that deal before any of it would happen, and votes are scheduled for later this week. Shoutout . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today\\'s Shoutout goes out to the social studies students and teachers at Salisbury High School in Salisbury, North Carolina! Which space shuttle went into orbit first? Here we go! Was it: A) Atlantis, B) Columbia, C) Discovery or D) Endeavour? Start the countdown at three seconds -- and GO! Columbia was the first shuttle to launch into orbit. That\\'s your answer and that\\'s your Shoutout! Retiring Shuttles . AZUZ: The launch happened exactly 30 years ago this week. And in honor of the anniversary, NASA is announcing where the shuttle fleet is going to spend its retirement. You\\'ll be able to visit Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Endeavour at a science center in Los Angeles. Discovery is headed to the Smithsonian in Washington. And Enterprise -- a shuttle that never actually went into space -- will be on display at a museum in New York. The 30th anniversary of Columbia\\'s first flight was also the 50th anniverary of a major milestone for the Russian space program. Matthew Chance has more on that celebration. (BEGIN VIDEO) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, MOSCOW: It was perhaps the greatest journey one man has ever taken. Propelled 50 years ago into space on a Soviet rocket, Yuri Gagarin made the first ever orbit of the Earth. For 108 minutes, he was crammed inside his tiny capsule, giving the world a vivid commentary of the planet far below. YURI GAGARIN, SOVIET COSMONAUT [TRANSLATED]: I am continuing the flight. The overload is somewhat increasing, as well as the vibration. But I am feeling well, and I\\'m in great spirits. I can see the Earth and can distinguish the features of its terrain. CHANCE: Well, this is just a replica of the actual Vostok capsule in which Yuri Gagarin made that first historic flight. For some reason, the original is kept in the museum of a state corporation and isn\\'t on general public view. But this space exhibition in Moscow is filled with originals, including a number of contemporaries of Yuri Gagarin himself. Men like Alexei Leonov, the first Soviet cosmonaut to conduct a spacewalk, here to celebrate the achievements of 50 years ago. ALEXEI LEONOV, RUSSIAN COSMONAUT [TRANSLATED]: In the past, we used to make a point of whether he or she was an American or a Russian or whatnot. In my view, if we don\\'t remember what happened 50 years ago, we will forget everything in 100 years. CHANCE: At the height of the Cold War, Gagarin\\'s success was a high-profile victory over the United States, seen as evidence of Soviet domination in the space race. He was dispatched overseas in what the Kremlin called \"missions of peace.\" It made him a global icon. And his flight on April 12, 1961 also led president John F. Kennedy to declare that America would put a man on the moon by 1970. Today, American astronauts are ready to acknowledge Gagarin\\'s pioneering mission. THOMAS STAFFORD, U.S. ASTRONAUT: Well, there always has to be a first (inaudible). And at the time, you know, there was a big competition (inaudible). I will say here today, without Yuri Gagarin\\'s flight, I probably would not have flown to the moon. CHANCE: Everybody\\'s friends now. STAFFORD: Oh, yes. CHANCE: Gagarin didn\\'t live to witness the hundreds who\\'ve journeyed to space since his first flight. He was killed in 1968 in a plane crash. But an untimely death has only added to the mythical status of the first man in space. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, do you remember the states we mentioned at the beginning of today\\'s show? You would if you were in this competition. It\\'s the U.S. Memory Championship; we\\'re talking mental muscle. The tournament involves memorizing names, faces and numbers. For one round, you have to memorize the order of a shuffled deck of playing cards. This year\\'s champion took home the title -- and broke two U.S. records along the way -- last month in New York. Goodbye . AZUZ: We were going to tell you about it then, but then we, uh, forgot. We hope you remember to tune in for more CNN Student News tomorrow. We\\'ll see you then.',\n",
       "  \"By . Sarah Womack . PUBLISHED: . 06:33 EST, 16 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:41 EST, 16 January 2014 . Poor Guy - he's around them all day long at the fast food chain where he works part-time, but Guy Sykes, 20, has a big problem: a phobia of onions. His chronic food fear - officially known as alliumphobia - means that although he's surrounded by food at the McDonald's restaurant where he works, he is drastically underweight for his six foot height. So while many start the New Year needing to shift a few pounds, Guy, from Berwick in Northumberland, wants to pile them on. Guy scans food ingredients in a desperate bid to avoid onions, his food phobia . He's surrounded by fast food but a phobia of onions leaves Guy Sykes seriously underweight for his height . But when he's not working, he's busy frantically scanning food ingredients for dreaded mentions of onions, the food stuff that freaks him out. At 6ft and weighing in at just eight and half stone, Guy was short of energy and knew he was seriously underweight for his height. On average, he was eating a quarter of the 3,000 calories he should have been getting for a man his age and height, having an energy drink for breakfast, no lunch and a tiny plate of pasta for dinner. Clothes hang off skinny Guy, who works around onions at McDonald's but has a phobia of them . A manager at McDonald's, the media student at Sunderland University said: 'I wasn’t a picky eater as a kid. I was one of those who’d have to have a clean plate before they could leave the table and would eat the same meals as my parents. I shot up at 14 and as I got older I knew I wasn’t the correct weight for someone of my height but I’ve never had much of an appetite. It doesn’t help that I’ve got an onion phobia. 'I have no idea why but everything about them I don’t like. Onions are a complete no-go for me and they are in so many meals. I’m constantly checking the lists of ingredients of things to see if there are onions as they are in so many meals.' Despite enjoying dishes such as steak, fish and a Sunday roast, Guy has struggled over the years to put on weight and his image was starting to have a negative impact on his mood. Guy wants to pile on the pounds but his onion phobia gets in the way . Wanting help, he applied for TV show Supersize vs Superskinny and tonight his efforts to pile on the pounds with the help of TV medic Dr Christian Jessen will be aired on Channel 4. Being partnered with someone struggling to lose weight Guy, who splits his time between Sunderland and his parents’ home in Berwick, had to match meal-for-meal the diet of Joanne Allen, weighing in at more than 19 stone, before the pair embarked on personalised diet plans. 'I was having to eat fried chicken, pizzas, all different kinds of takeaways every three hours a day. I was taking in 6,000 calories and found it really difficult,' said Guy. 'By the end of each day I felt physically drained with the sheer amount of food. We were then given a diet plan and given six weeks to try and change our weight. 'I decided to do it for myself and started making changes eating what I thought would be better. It was a conscious effort each day to make my portion sizes bigger and make sure I had three meals a day as well as snacking.' In six weeks Guy put on half a stone, and by sticking to his new diet plan, he’s now nearing a one stone weight gain. Guy, who still works at the fast food chain in his home town said: 'During the show I was told it is harder for people to lose weight than put it on and you have to double your daily calorie intake to put on just a couple of pounds. 'I’ve been sticking with it and would like to get up to 10 stone, and if I reach that target I’ll keep going.'\"],\n",

       "'LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won\\'t cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don\\'t plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he\\'ll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I\\'ll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe\\'s earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say \\'kid star goes off the rails,\\'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter\\'s latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer\\'s \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he\\'s legally an adult: \"I just think I\\'m going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

Three members of the same family who died in a static caravan from carbon monoxide poisoning would have been unconscious 'within minutes', investigators said today. The bodies of married couple John and Audrey Cook were discovered alongside their daughter, Maureen, at the mobile home they shared on Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, west Cornwall. The inquests have now opened into the deaths last Saturday, with investigators saying the three died along with the family's pet dog, of carbon monoxide poisoning from a cooker. Tragic: The inquests have opened into the deaths of three members of the same family who were found in their static caravan last weekend. John and Audrey Cook are pictured . Awful: The family died following carbon monoxide poisoning at this caravan at the Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, Cornwall . It is also believed there was no working carbon monoxide detector in the static caravan. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said this would have resulted in the three being unconscious 'within minutes', . A spokesman for Cornwall coroner Dr Emma Carlyon confirmed the inquests were opened and adjourned yesterday afternoon. They will resume at a later date. Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed on Monday that carbon monoxide poisoning had been established as the cause of death. A police spokesman said the source of the poisoning was 'believed to be from incorrect operation of the gas cooker'. Poisoning: This woman left flowers outside the caravan following the deaths. It has emerged that the trio would have been unconscious 'within minutes' Touching: This tribute was left outside the caravan following news of the deaths . Early readings from experts at the site revealed a potentially lethal level of carbon monoxide present within the caravan at the time it was taken, shortly after the discovery of the bodies. Friends and neighbours have paid tribute to the trio. One . neighbour, Sonya Owen, 53, said: 'It's very distressing. I knew the . daughter, she was living her with her mum and dad. Everybody is really . upset.' Margaret Holmes, 65, who lived near the couple and their . daughter, said: 'They had lived here for around 40 years and they kept . themselves to themselves. 'I just can’t believe this has . happened, it is so sad and I am so shocked, I think we all are, you just . don’t expect this sort of thing to happen on your doorstep. 'Everyone will miss them, we used to chat a lot when we were both in the garden. 'I would just like to send my condolences to their family, I can’t imagine what they’re going through.' Nic Clark, 52, who was good friends with daughter Maureen, added: 'They were a lovely kind family, a great trio. 'Maureen . used to go out and walk her dog, a little Jack Russell, it is so sad . what has happened, I understand the dog went with them. 'They . will be sorely missed and I think everyone is just in shock at the . moment, I would like to send my condolences to the Cook family.'\""
