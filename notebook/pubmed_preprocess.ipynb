       " \"the result of this community intervention study revealed that nutrition intervention based on advocacy program had been successful to reduce the prevalence of underweight among poor girls . this study shows determinant factor of nutritional status of school age children was their socio - economic level . according to our knowledge , this is the first study , which determines the effect of a community intervention based on advocacy process on the malnutrition indices in a big city ( shiraz ) in iran . the other program in iran ( nffp ) is specified to deprived area and is not conducted in big cities . allocating millions of dollars to nffp by government , selecting the malnourished students through an active screening system at primary and middle schools , paying attention of policy makers to student 's nutrition have provided the opportunity to combat the problem . however , negligence of under - poverty line , providing poor snacks in terms of nutritional value and lack of variety are the main defects of this program . advocacy by definition is a blending of science , ethics and politics for comprehensive approaching health issues . by using advocacy program in california among the high school students for improving their nutrition and physical activity angeles unified school district participants emphasized on nutrition classes for families as well as students in addition to other interventions . in the present study another study revealed that evaluability assessment gave stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the project and its implementation issues . it seems that in iran , free food program among the students not only is needed in deprived areas , but also it should be performed in big cities such as shiraz . at baseline , no significant difference was founded among wealthy students between the pre- and post - nutritional status intervention . in contrast , the numbers of students who have malnutrition decreased from 44% to 39.4% , which was identified as a significant among impecunious girls students . there was also a significant increase in the proportion of children with bmi that was normal for age ( 2 to + 1 sd ) most of the published community interventions showed better results among females compared with males . this difference in the impact of nutritional interventions between male and female might be related to the different age of puberty in the female population compared to the male population . in the age range of the present study female although , there is no nffp in big cities of iran , there are some programs for improving the nutritional status such as providing free milk in schools . a recent publication has shown that school feeding programs focus on milk supplementation had beneficial effects on the physical function and school performances specifically among girls in iran . the results of the mentioned study showed an improvement in the weight of children , psychological test 's scores and the grade - point average following this school feeding program . the intervention in the present study had focused on the snack intake in the school time . there are some reports regarding the nutrition transition in iran , which shows the importance of nutrition intervention to provide more healthy eating dietary habits among welfare groups of adolescents . hence , nutrition intervention especially in the form of nutrition education is needed in big cities and among welfare children and adolescents . although a study among iranian adolescents showed that dietary behavior of adolescents does not accord to their knowledge , which emphasize on the necessity of community intervention programs . a recent study regarding the major dietary pattern among iranian children showed the presence of four major dietary patterns , in which fast food pattern and sweet pattern as two major dietary patterns can be mentioned among iranian children . in advocacy program audience 's analysis accordingly , one of the prominent strategies in this study was working with media and was meeting with parent - teacher association that both of them were secondary target audiences . we also took into account policy makers in different levels , from national to local as primary audiences . advocacy team had several meetings with management and planning organization at national level and education organization of the fars province as well as principal of the targeted schools . providing nutritious snacks need contribution of private sector such as food industries or factories , but their benefits should be warranted . another choice was community involvement ; which can be achieved by female health volunteers who are working with the health system . advocacy team by using the support of charities and female health volunteers could establish a local factory that produced student 's snacks based on the new definition . however , there are some challenges on the way of expanding this program . mass production of the proposed snacks according to different desires and cultures and getting involvement of food industries with respect to marketing issues is one of those challenges . moreover , providing a supportive environment in order to change the food habits of the students and their parents among the wide range of the population require a sustainable and continuous inter - sector collaboration . although in a limited number of schools , in our study , interventions and advocacy program was successful , expanding this model to another areas around the country depends on convincing the policy makers at national level . in this regard , advocacy team should prepare evidenced based profile and transitional planning to convince the policy makers for improving the rule and regulation of nffp . the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight , obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention . assessing the dietary adherence is very important in nutrition intervention among population . as this population was children and adolescents we had a limitation in the blood sample collection to assess the subject 's dietary adherence . furthermore , this intervention was only focused on the intake of snack in school time and we did not have comprehensive information on the dietary intake of children and adolescents after school all over the day . the investigators propose further investigation in different areas of the country based on socio - cultural differences in order to make necessary modification and adapt this model to other areas . regarding the nutritional needs of the school age children , provision of a good platform for implementing and expanding this efficient model to the whole country based upon the socio - economic situation of each region is advisable to the moh and the moe .\",\n",

       " \"the result of this community intervention study revealed that nutrition intervention based on advocacy program had been successful to reduce the prevalence of underweight among poor girls . this study shows determinant factor of nutritional status of school age children was their socio - economic level . according to our knowledge , this is the first study , which determines the effect of a community intervention based on advocacy process on the malnutrition indices in a big city ( shiraz ) in iran . the other program in iran ( nffp ) is specified to deprived area and is not conducted in big cities . allocating millions of dollars to nffp by government , selecting the malnourished students through an active screening system at primary and middle schools , paying attention of policy makers to student 's nutrition have provided the opportunity to combat the problem . however , negligence of under - poverty line , providing poor snacks in terms of nutritional value and lack of variety are the main defects of this program . advocacy by definition is a blending of science , ethics and politics for comprehensive approaching health issues . by using advocacy program in california among the high school students for improving their nutrition and physical activity angeles unified school district participants emphasized on nutrition classes for families as well as students in addition to other interventions . in the present study another study revealed that evaluability assessment gave stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the project and its implementation issues . it seems that in iran , free food program among the students not only is needed in deprived areas , but also it should be performed in big cities such as shiraz . at baseline , no significant difference was founded among wealthy students between the pre- and post - nutritional status intervention . in contrast , the numbers of students who have malnutrition decreased from 44% to 39.4% , which was identified as a significant among impecunious girls students . there was also a significant increase in the proportion of children with bmi that was normal for age ( 2 to + 1 sd ) most of the published community interventions showed better results among females compared with males . this difference in the impact of nutritional interventions between male and female might be related to the different age of puberty in the female population compared to the male population . in the age range of the present study female although , there is no nffp in big cities of iran , there are some programs for improving the nutritional status such as providing free milk in schools . a recent publication has shown that school feeding programs focus on milk supplementation had beneficial effects on the physical function and school performances specifically among girls in iran . the results of the mentioned study showed an improvement in the weight of children , psychological test 's scores and the grade - point average following this school feeding program . the intervention in the present study had focused on the snack intake in the school time . there are some reports regarding the nutrition transition in iran , which shows the importance of nutrition intervention to provide more healthy eating dietary habits among welfare groups of adolescents . hence , nutrition intervention especially in the form of nutrition education is needed in big cities and among welfare children and adolescents . although a study among iranian adolescents showed that dietary behavior of adolescents does not accord to their knowledge , which emphasize on the necessity of community intervention programs . a recent study regarding the major dietary pattern among iranian children showed the presence of four major dietary patterns , in which fast food pattern and sweet pattern as two major dietary patterns can be mentioned among iranian children . in advocacy program audience 's analysis accordingly , one of the prominent strategies in this study was working with media and was meeting with parent - teacher association that both of them were secondary target audiences . we also took into account policy makers in different levels , from national to local as primary audiences . advocacy team had several meetings with management and planning organization at national level and education organization of the fars province as well as principal of the targeted schools . providing nutritious snacks need contribution of private sector such as food industries or factories , but their benefits should be warranted . another choice was community involvement ; which can be achieved by female health volunteers who are working with the health system . advocacy team by using the support of charities and female health volunteers could establish a local factory that produced student 's snacks based on the new definition . however , there are some challenges on the way of expanding this program . mass production of the proposed snacks according to different desires and cultures and getting involvement of food industries with respect to marketing issues is one of those challenges . moreover , providing a supportive environment in order to change the food habits of the students and their parents among the wide range of the population require a sustainable and continuous inter - sector collaboration . although in a limited number of schools , in our study , interventions and advocacy program was successful , expanding this model to another areas around the country depends on convincing the policy makers at national level . in this regard , advocacy team should prepare evidenced based profile and transitional planning to convince the policy makers for improving the rule and regulation of nffp . the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight , obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention . assessing the dietary adherence is very important in nutrition intervention among population . as this population was children and adolescents we had a limitation in the blood sample collection to assess the subject 's dietary adherence . furthermore , this intervention was only focused on the intake of snack in school time and we did not have comprehensive information on the dietary intake of children and adolescents after school all over the day . the investigators propose further investigation in different areas of the country based on socio - cultural differences in order to make necessary modification and adapt this model to other areas . regarding the nutritional needs of the school age children , provision of a good platform for implementing and expanding this efficient model to the whole country based upon the socio - economic situation of each region is advisable to the moh and the moe .\",\n",

three percent of patients had previously undergone a subacromial decompression but symptoms persisted until the biceps tenodesis was carried out . this would suggest that biceps tendinitis is a primary event.secondary tendonitis [ 14 , 15 , 17 , 27 ] : this may further be subdivided into three main types , inflammatory , instability , and traumatic . clearly , there is a huge overlap between these categories and in fact biceps pathology is very rarely a single entity . apart from this , the most recent biomechanical data come from youm et al .   who found that loading of the long head of biceps tendon significantly affects the glenohumeral joint , range of movement , translations , and kinematics . therefore , varied anatomical knowledge of the bg is important as abnormalities of the bicipital tendon and its synovial sheath have been implicated in a variety of causes of shoulder pain and disability [ 6 , 7 ] . a radiological study recommended that the entire length of the bg be examined to determine the osseous anatomy of the groove . few authors have studied the morphology of the upper end of the humerus in geographically diversified regions [ 10 , 3133 ] . primary tendonitis : berlemann and bayley   reported the long term results of 14 patients ( 15 shoulders ) following keyhole biceps tenodesis . fifty -

       " 'the study was carried out using hundred and one humeri of assorted sex and pair . the subjects consisted of 45 left and 56 right humeri obtained from osteology laboratory of kg medical university , lucknow , up , india . the lengths of medial , lateral walls , depth , lengths , and width of bicipital groove ( figure 1 ) were measured by digital vernier callipers .   the statistical analyses consisting of not only incidences of supratuberecular ridge of meyer and presence of bony spurs but also mean , standard deviation , range , median and mode of length of medial and lateral walls , width , depth , and opening / medial wall angles of bg were carried out . the opening / medial wall angles of bg ( figure 2 ) have been computed .   the narrowness and shallowness of bg have been redefined objectively in relation to dimensions of both bicipital groove and biceps tendon for adequate prediction of pathologies of biceps tendon . though the precise definition of narrowness / shallowness of bg is difficult yet systematic , relative and constrained definition depending on the dimensions of bicep tendon and its natural abode , that is , bicipital groove , is formulated as follows.if the width of bg is less than the width of biceps tendon , it is a narrow bg which may produce attritional changes causing impingement , inflammation , and degeneration . similarly , if the depth of the groove is less than height of the bicep tendon , it is shallow causing subluxation or dislocation which in the long run may cause degenerative changes and rupture . if the width of bg is less than the width of biceps tendon , it is a narrow bg which may produce attritional changes causing impingement , inflammation , and degeneration .   similarly , if the depth of the groove is less than height of the bicep tendon , it is shallow causing subluxation or dislocation which in the long run may cause degenerative changes and rupture . as the new definition of narrowness or shallowness requires the width and height of biceps tendon , so the width and height of 4 biceps tendons from 2 cadavers have also been measured to provide more realistic definition of narrow / shallow of bicipital groove .',\n",
       " 'the means  standard deviation of lengths of medial and lateral walls , width , depth and opening / medial wall angles of bg have been computed as shown in table 1 . mean length of medial wall of bg on right side was 22  4 and that on left side was 23  5  mm ( table 1 ) . mean length of lateral wall of bg on right side was 31  6  mm and that on left side was 31  5  mm . mean width on the superior part of bg on right side was 8  2  mm and that on left side was 8  2  mm . the depth of bg on right side was 5  1  mm and that on left side was 6  1  mm . the incidence of supratubercular ridge was 37% total , 17% on right side , and 20% on left side . the average length of bg is 26.7% of total length of the humerus and average width of bg is 52% of average width of humerus . the width and height of biceps tendon ( figure 3 ) have been displayed in table 2 .',\n",
       " \"the morphometric study carried out by various authors [ 25 , 3437 ] has been compared with present study as depicted in table 3 .   lengths of medial wall and lateral walls of bg have not been reported so far except in the present study , so there is no data for comparison . length of bg in present study is comparable with that of murlimanju but slightly higher than that observed by wafae et al . the width of bg under present study is close to that of cone et al . but slightly higher than that of murlimanju and lower than that of wafae et al . median of width of bg on right and left sides are 8 and 10  mm , respectively , and mode is 8  mm on each side . it indicates that width of bg in most of the north indian population is 8  mm . in the present study depth of bg more than 3  mm and depth ranging 46  mm are 98% and 96% of humeri , respectively , as against 90% and 86% in the study of cone et al . median and mode of depth in right / left side are 5/6  mm each . medial wall angle of bg is slightly higher than that of joseph and lower than cone et al . medial wall angle ( mwa ) in my study is lower than cone and higher than joseph . the median and mode of these morphometric parameters of bg are very useful for prosthetic sizing , positioning , and designing .   the supratubercular ridge in present study is found in 17% in right and 20% in left totalling to 37% in all humerii . as per hitchcock and bechtol cone et al .   from their radiographic interpretations observed this ridge in 50% of cases and reported that it was not pathologically significant . observed this ridge in 88% on right side and 57% on left side and emphasised that it was more important on right side than left to prevent medial displacement of long head of biceps from the bg . in present study mean width and height of biceps tendon ( figure 3 ) are 10.5 and 1.6  mm , respectively , which is higher than that observed by lam and mok . similarly these dimensions of tendon at the exit from bg are 7 and 1.8  mm , respectively . the width of tendon at the exit is more and height is less than that observed by lam and mok .   if the tendon is not encased by median and lateral walls of bg due to its shallow depth it may be dislocated , either partially or fully by biomechanical movements of arms . this dislocation of biceps tendon associated with impingement may cause degeneration leading to partial or full rupture with the passage of time . apart from this , if the movements of tendon are not free in narrow or in presence of bony spurs in bg during biomechanical movements of shoulder joint , its constant fraying might give rise to pathologies of biceps tendon . reported that wide grooves ( i.e. , > 17  mm ) were often shallow . but in a groove 3  mm deep or less , it should be viewed with suspicion in managing pathologic conditions of the shoulder on patient radiographs as per cone 's view . pfahler et al .   found a flat groove angle associated with radiologic depth less than 2  mm . they found a significant accumulation of pathologically changed biceps tendons when a flat groove angle was present . according to several authors subluxation and dislocation of biceps tendon were more common in presence of shallow bicipital groove [ 1 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 39 ] . it is also reported that with shallow bicipital groove , the tendon is susceptible to chronic trauma due to impingement by the overlying acromion , rotator cuff , and coracoacromial arch during shoulder movement . a shallow intertubercular groove is vulnerable to impingement damage and subluxation [ 37 , 40 ] . rupture of the biceps tendon most commonly occurs proximally near the glenoid labrum and distally in the bicipital groove . smith   designated bicipital groove types as narrow , normal and shallow depending on mean opening angle less than 66 , 94 , and 118.   as seen from above description , the objective and realistic definition has not been given by any author . therefore , present author has attempted reliable , realistic , and objective definition of shallowness of bg in relation to biceps tendon as given in section 2 of this paper . this definition of shallowness can be realised in situ in live patients only but is expected to elucidate the pathologies associated with shallowness of the groove . as per morphometric data ( table 3 ) of bg and biceps tendon as observed in two cadavers in the present study , the groove is not shallow according to new definition of shallowness . figure 3 shows the biceps tendon and bg in a dissected cadaver wherein the biceps tendon is positioned and perfectly well protected in bg . the bg in this case is not shallow as seen in the above - mentioned figure , and the height of biceps tendon is less than depth of bg . continual mechanical stress at anatomically narrow sites ( i.e. , distal bicipital groove , beneath the acromion or the coracoacromial ligament ) and impingement of the biceps tendon in the coracoacromial arch during flexion may cause these well - known degenerative changes [ 19 , 41 ] . in the present study the data of bg and biceps tendon observed from two cadavers do not indicate narrow bg as per new definition of narrowness and shallowness given in section 2 . did not find any conspicuous anatomic findings of the bicipital groove in the shoulders effected by rotator cuff diseases on mri such as a narrow groove , flat groove , or small medial groove that were predictive of biceps pathology at the time of arthroscopy [ 37 , 38 ] . this may be because of the following limitations of josheph 's study , subjective / qualitative definition of shallowness and narrowness . limitations of josheph 's study , subjective / qualitative definition of shallowness and narrowness . the limitations to josheph 's study were as follows : clearly a selection bias to surgical patients suffering from primary rotator cuff disease , only patients having mri done , classification of biceps tendon pathology was arbitrary and based purely on visual inspection not on histopathologic changes , mri is often considered to be less accurate than x - ray or computed tomography scan in evaluating bony dimensions . clearly a selection bias   to surgical patients suffering from primary rotator cuff disease , only patients having mri done , to surgical patients suffering from primary rotator cuff disease ,   only patients having mri done , classification of biceps tendon pathology was arbitrary and based purely on visual inspection not on histopathologic changes ,   mri is often considered to be less accurate than x -

       " 'the study was carried out using hundred and one humeri of assorted sex and pair . the subjects consisted of 45 left and 56 right humeri obtained from osteology laboratory of kg medical university , lucknow , up , india . the lengths of medial , lateral walls , depth , lengths , and width of bicipital groove ( figure 1 ) were measured by digital vernier callipers .   the statistical analyses consisting of not only incidences of supratuberecular ridge of meyer and presence of bony spurs but also mean , standard deviation , range , median and mode of length of medial and lateral walls , width , depth , and opening / medial wall angles of bg were carried out . the opening / medial wall angles of bg ( figure 2 ) have been computed .   the narrowness and shallowness of bg have been redefined objectively in relation to dimensions of both bicipital groove and biceps tendon for adequate prediction of pathologies of biceps tendon . though the precise definition of narrowness / shallowness of bg is difficult yet systematic , relative and constrained definition depending on the dimensions of bicep tendon and its natural abode , that is , bicipital groove , is formulated as follows.if the width of bg is less than the width of biceps tendon , it is a narrow bg which may produce attritional changes causing impingement , inflammation , and degeneration . similarly , if the depth of the groove is less than height of the bicep tendon , it is shallow causing subluxation or dislocation which in the long run may cause degenerative changes and rupture . if the width of bg is less than the width of biceps tendon , it is a narrow bg which may produce attritional changes causing impingement , inflammation , and degeneration .   similarly , if the depth of the groove is less than height of the bicep tendon , it is shallow causing subluxation or dislocation which in the long run may cause degenerative changes and rupture . as the new definition of narrowness or shallowness requires the width and height of biceps tendon , so the width and height of 4 biceps tendons from 2 cadavers have also been measured to provide more realistic definition of narrow / shallow of bicipital groove .',\n",
       " 'the means  standard deviation of lengths of medial and lateral walls , width , depth and opening / medial wall angles of bg have been computed as shown in table 1 . mean length of medial wall of bg on right side was 22  4 and that on left side was 23  5  mm ( table 1 ) . mean length of lateral wall of bg on right side was 31  6  mm and that on left side was 31  5  mm . mean width on the superior part of bg on right side was 8  2  mm and that on left side was 8  2  mm . the depth of bg on right side was 5  1  mm and that on left side was 6  1  mm . the incidence of supratubercular ridge was 37% total , 17% on right side , and 20% on left side . the average length of bg is 26.7% of total length of the humerus and average width of bg is 52% of average width of humerus . the width and height of biceps tendon ( figure 3 ) have been displayed in table 2 .',\n",
       " \"the morphometric study carried out by various authors [ 25 , 3437 ] has been compared with present study as depicted in table 3 .   lengths of medial wall and lateral walls of bg have not been reported so far except in the present study , so there is no data for comparison . length of bg in present study is comparable with that of murlimanju but slightly higher than that observed by wafae et al . the width of bg under present study is close to that of cone et al . but slightly higher than that of murlimanju and lower than that of wafae et al . median of width of bg on right and left sides are 8 and 10  mm , respectively , and mode is 8  mm on each side . it indicates that width of bg in most of the north indian population is 8  mm . in the present study depth of bg more than 3  mm and depth ranging 46  mm are 98% and 96% of humeri , respectively , as against 90% and 86% in the study of cone et al . median and mode of depth in right / left side are 5/6  mm each . medial wall angle of bg is slightly higher than that of joseph and lower than cone et al . medial wall angle ( mwa ) in my study is lower than cone and higher than joseph . the median and mode of these morphometric parameters of bg are very useful for prosthetic sizing , positioning , and designing .   the supratubercular ridge in present study is found in 17% in right and 20% in left totalling to 37% in all humerii . as per hitchcock and bechtol cone et al .   from their radiographic interpretations observed this ridge in 50% of cases and reported that it was not pathologically significant . observed this ridge in 88% on right side and 57% on left side and emphasised that it was more important on right side than left to prevent medial displacement of long head of biceps from the bg . in present study mean width and height of biceps tendon ( figure 3 ) are 10.5 and 1.6  mm , respectively , which is higher than that observed by lam and mok . similarly these dimensions of tendon at the exit from bg are 7 and 1.8  mm , respectively . the width of tendon at the exit is more and height is less than that observed by lam and mok .   if the tendon is not encased by median and lateral walls of bg due to its shallow depth it may be dislocated , either partially or fully by biomechanical movements of arms . this dislocation of biceps tendon associated with impingement may cause degeneration leading to partial or full rupture with the passage of time . apart from this , if the movements of tendon are not free in narrow or in presence of bony spurs in bg during biomechanical movements of shoulder joint , its constant fraying might give rise to pathologies of biceps tendon . reported that wide grooves ( i.e. , > 17  mm ) were often shallow . but in a groove 3  mm deep or less , it should be viewed with suspicion in managing pathologic conditions of the shoulder on patient radiographs as per cone 's view . pfahler et al .   found a flat groove angle associated with radiologic depth less than 2  mm . they found a significant accumulation of pathologically changed biceps tendons when a flat groove angle was present . according to several authors subluxation and dislocation of biceps tendon were more common in presence of shallow bicipital groove [ 1 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 39 ] . it is also reported that with shallow bicipital groove , the tendon is susceptible to chronic trauma due to impingement by the overlying acromion , rotator cuff , and coracoacromial arch during shoulder movement . a shallow intertubercular groove is vulnerable to impingement damage and subluxation [ 37 , 40 ] . rupture of the biceps tendon most commonly occurs proximally near the glenoid labrum and distally in the bicipital groove . smith   designated bicipital groove types as narrow , normal and shallow depending on mean opening angle less than 66 , 94 , and 118.   as seen from above description , the objective and realistic definition has not been given by any author . therefore , present author has attempted reliable , realistic , and objective definition of shallowness of bg in relation to biceps tendon as given in section 2 of this paper . this definition of shallowness can be realised in situ in live patients only but is expected to elucidate the pathologies associated with shallowness of the groove . as per morphometric data ( table 3 ) of bg and biceps tendon as observed in two cadavers in the present study , the groove is not shallow according to new definition of shallowness . figure 3 shows the biceps tendon and bg in a dissected cadaver wherein the biceps tendon is positioned and perfectly well protected in bg . the bg in this case is not shallow as seen in the above - mentioned figure , and the height of biceps tendon is less than depth of bg . continual mechanical stress at anatomically narrow sites ( i.e. , distal bicipital groove , beneath the acromion or the coracoacromial ligament ) and impingement of the biceps tendon in the coracoacromial arch during flexion may cause these well - known degenerative changes [ 19 , 41 ] . in the present study the data of bg and biceps tendon observed from two cadavers do not indicate narrow bg as per new definition of narrowness and shallowness given in section 2 . did not find any conspicuous anatomic findings of the bicipital groove in the shoulders effected by rotator cuff diseases on mri such as a narrow groove , flat groove , or small medial groove that were predictive of biceps pathology at the time of arthroscopy [ 37 , 38 ] . this may be because of the following limitations of josheph 's study , subjective / qualitative definition of shallowness and narrowness . limitations of josheph 's study , subjective / qualitative definition of shallowness and narrowness . the limitations to josheph 's study were as follows : clearly a selection bias to surgical patients suffering from primary rotator cuff disease , only patients having mri done , classification of biceps tendon pathology was arbitrary and based purely on visual inspection not on histopathologic changes , mri is often considered to be less accurate than x - ray or computed tomography scan in evaluating bony dimensions . clearly a selection bias   to surgical patients suffering from primary rotator cuff disease , only patients having mri done , to surgical patients suffering from primary rotator cuff disease ,   only patients having mri done , classification of biceps tendon pathology was arbitrary and based purely on visual inspection not on histopathologic changes ,   mri is often considered to be less accurate than x -

       " 'lesions due to pathology of biceps tendon have been postulated to be among the most frequent causes of pain and disability in the shoulder . biceps tendon pathology has been visualized in three main categories , namely , instability , inflammatory , and traumatic . abboud et al .   divided the biceps tendon pathology in normal , inflamed , partially torn , or ruptured tendon . acute inflammatory and chronic degenerative alterations causing partial / complete rupture and subluxation / dislocation can be found in the long head of the biceps tendon . instability of biceps tendon besides other factors may be attributed to length of medial / lateral walls , opening / medial wall angles depending on width / depth constituting shallowness of bg , and presence of supratubercular ridge [ 37 , 40 , 41 ] . the implication of longer walls is expected to ensure greater stability to biceps tendon lying in the bicipital groove than the shorter walls during multidirectional biomechanical movements . but the rider to this fact is that it may also cause attritional friction in a longer length of biceps tendon surrounded by longer walls creating inflammation under narrow conditions of bg . as the lengths of medial and lateral walls decrease , the instability increases and the tendon is likely to be damaged . the inference drawn is based on reconstruction of anatomical model of this part of the human body advancing the knowledge and experience of anatomy and clinical studies recorded in the literature supported by logical force as the study is on dry bones . range provides an idea of length of these walls in north indian population , whereas the mean  sd reveals the average size of bg . the median may be very useful in planning surgical procedures in this part of the body . mode is representative of most frequent incidence of lengths of these walls in the subject population . if the instability of biceps tendon is studied in relation to lengths of bg most frequent value of length of walls may play a vital role in diagnostics of tendon instability or attritional damage .   felt that a groove 3  mm deep or less and more than 17  mm wide may predispose to tendon subluxation or dislocation on patient radiographs . the flat groove of pfahler et al .   was found to depict significant accumulation of pathologic changes in biceps tendon in 62% of cases on sonography . the supratubercular ridge of meyer and a prematurely shallow bicipital or intertubercular sulcus have been postulated to result in a variety of lesions after repetitive use or acute trauma [ 37 , 40 , 41 ] . these include acute or chronic peritendonitis , varying degrees of attrition or damage to the tendon , and subluxation or complete dislocation . as the biceps tendon is enshrined in bg , width may influence the pathology occurring in this tendon . in wider groove the tendon',\n",
