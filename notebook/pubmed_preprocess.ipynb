       "[\"a recent systematic analysis showed that in 2011 , 314 ( 296 - 331 ) million children younger than 5 years were mildly , moderately or severely stunted and 258 ( 240 - 274 ) million were mildly , moderately or severely underweight in the developing countries . in iran a study among 752 high school girls in sistan and baluchestan showed prevalence of 16.2% , 8.6% and 1.5% , for underweight , overweight and obesity , respectively . the prevalence of malnutrition among elementary school aged children in tehran varied from 6% to 16% . anthropometric study of elementary school students in shiraz revealed that 16% of them suffer from malnutrition and low body weight . snack should have 300 - 400 kcal energy and could provide 5 - 10 g of protein / day . nowadays , school nutrition programs are running as the national programs , world - wide . national school lunch program in the united states there are also some reports regarding school feeding programs in developing countries . in vietnam , school base program showed an improvement in nutrient intakes . in iran a national free food program ( nffp ) is implemented in elementary schools of deprived areas to cover all poor students . however , this program is not conducted in slums and poor areas of the big cities so many malnourished children with low socio - economic situation are not covered by nffp . although the rate of poverty in areas known as deprived is higher than other areas , many students in deprived areas are not actually poor and can afford food . hence , nutritional value of the nffp is lower than the scientific recommended snacks for this age group . furthermore , lack of variety of food packages has decreased the tendency of children toward nffp . on the other hand , the most important one is ministry of education ( moe ) of iran , which is responsible for selecting and providing the packages for targeted schools . the ministry of health ( moh ) is supervising the health situation of students and their health needs . welfare organizations , along with charities , have the indirect effect on nutritional status of students by financial support of their family . provincial governors have also the role of coordinating and supervising all activities of these organizations . parent - teacher association is a community - based institution that participates in school 's policy such as nffp . in addition to these organizations , nutritional literacy of students , their parents and teachers , is a very important issue , which could affect nutritional status of school age children . therefore , the present study was conducted with the aim of improving the nffp , so that by its resources all poor children will be covered even in big cities . moreover , all food packages were replaced by nutritious and diverse packages that were accessible for non - poor children . according to the aim of this study and multiple factors that could affect the problem , public health advocacy has been chosen as the best strategy to deal with this issue . therefore , the present study determines the effects of nutrition intervention in an advocacy process model on the prevalence of underweight in school aged children in the poor area of shiraz , iran .\",\n",

       " \"the result of this community intervention study revealed that nutrition intervention based on advocacy program had been successful to reduce the prevalence of underweight among poor girls . this study shows determinant factor of nutritional status of school age children was their socio - economic level . according to our knowledge , this is the first study , which determines the effect of a community intervention based on advocacy process on the malnutrition indices in a big city ( shiraz ) in iran . the other program in iran ( nffp ) is specified to deprived area and is not conducted in big cities . allocating millions of dollars to nffp by government , selecting the malnourished students through an active screening system at primary and middle schools , paying attention of policy makers to student 's nutrition have provided the opportunity to combat the problem . however , negligence of under - poverty line , providing poor snacks in terms of nutritional value and lack of variety are the main defects of this program . advocacy by definition is a blending of science , ethics and politics for comprehensive approaching health issues . by using advocacy program in california among the high school students for improving their nutrition and physical activity angeles unified school district participants emphasized on nutrition classes for families as well as students in addition to other interventions . in the present study another study revealed that evaluability assessment gave stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the project and its implementation issues . it seems that in iran , free food program among the students not only is needed in deprived areas , but also it should be performed in big cities such as shiraz . at baseline , no significant difference was founded among wealthy students between the pre- and post - nutritional status intervention . in contrast , the numbers of students who have malnutrition decreased from 44% to 39.4% , which was identified as a significant among impecunious girls students . there was also a significant increase in the proportion of children with bmi that was normal for age ( 2 to + 1 sd ) most of the published community interventions showed better results among females compared with males . this difference in the impact of nutritional interventions between male and female might be related to the different age of puberty in the female population compared to the male population . in the age range of the present study female although , there is no nffp in big cities of iran , there are some programs for improving the nutritional status such as providing free milk in schools . a recent publication has shown that school feeding programs focus on milk supplementation had beneficial effects on the physical function and school performances specifically among girls in iran . the results of the mentioned study showed an improvement in the weight of children , psychological test 's scores and the grade - point average following this school feeding program . the intervention in the present study had focused on the snack intake in the school time . there are some reports regarding the nutrition transition in iran , which shows the importance of nutrition intervention to provide more healthy eating dietary habits among welfare groups of adolescents . hence , nutrition intervention especially in the form of nutrition education is needed in big cities and among welfare children and adolescents . although a study among iranian adolescents showed that dietary behavior of adolescents does not accord to their knowledge , which emphasize on the necessity of community intervention programs . a recent study regarding the major dietary pattern among iranian children showed the presence of four major dietary patterns , in which fast food pattern and sweet pattern as two major dietary patterns can be mentioned among iranian children . in advocacy program audience 's analysis accordingly , one of the prominent strategies in this study was working with media and was meeting with parent - teacher association that both of them were secondary target audiences . we also took into account policy makers in different levels , from national to local as primary audiences . advocacy team had several meetings with management and planning organization at national level and education organization of the fars province as well as principal of the targeted schools . providing nutritious snacks need contribution of private sector such as food industries or factories , but their benefits should be warranted . another choice was community involvement ; which can be achieved by female health volunteers who are working with the health system . advocacy team by using the support of charities and female health volunteers could establish a local factory that produced student 's snacks based on the new definition . however , there are some challenges on the way of expanding this program . mass production of the proposed snacks according to different desires and cultures and getting involvement of food industries with respect to marketing issues is one of those challenges . moreover , providing a supportive environment in order to change the food habits of the students and their parents among the wide range of the population require a sustainable and continuous inter - sector collaboration . although in a limited number of schools , in our study , interventions and advocacy program was successful , expanding this model to another areas around the country depends on convincing the policy makers at national level . in this regard , advocacy team should prepare evidenced based profile and transitional planning to convince the policy makers for improving the rule and regulation of nffp . the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight , obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention . assessing the dietary adherence is very important in nutrition intervention among population . as this population was children and adolescents we had a limitation in the blood sample collection to assess the subject 's dietary adherence . furthermore , this intervention was only focused on the intake of snack in school time and we did not have comprehensive information on the dietary intake of children and adolescents after school all over the day . the investigators propose further investigation in different areas of the country based on socio - cultural differences in order to make necessary modification and adapt this model to other areas . regarding the nutritional needs of the school age children , provision of a good platform for implementing and expanding this efficient model to the whole country based upon the socio - economic situation of each region is advisable to the moh and the moe .\",\n",

       " \"the result of this community intervention study revealed that nutrition intervention based on advocacy program had been successful to reduce the prevalence of underweight among poor girls . this study shows determinant factor of nutritional status of school age children was their socio - economic level . according to our knowledge , this is the first study , which determines the effect of a community intervention based on advocacy process on the malnutrition indices in a big city ( shiraz ) in iran . the other program in iran ( nffp ) is specified to deprived area and is not conducted in big cities . allocating millions of dollars to nffp by government , selecting the malnourished students through an active screening system at primary and middle schools , paying attention of policy makers to student 's nutrition have provided the opportunity to combat the problem . however , negligence of under - poverty line , providing poor snacks in terms of nutritional value and lack of variety are the main defects of this program . advocacy by definition is a blending of science , ethics and politics for comprehensive approaching health issues . by using advocacy program in california among the high school students for improving their nutrition and physical activity angeles unified school district participants emphasized on nutrition classes for families as well as students in addition to other interventions . in the present study another study revealed that evaluability assessment gave stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the project and its implementation issues . it seems that in iran , free food program among the students not only is needed in deprived areas , but also it should be performed in big cities such as shiraz . at baseline , no significant difference was founded among wealthy students between the pre- and post - nutritional status intervention . in contrast , the numbers of students who have malnutrition decreased from 44% to 39.4% , which was identified as a significant among impecunious girls students . there was also a significant increase in the proportion of children with bmi that was normal for age ( 2 to + 1 sd ) most of the published community interventions showed better results among females compared with males . this difference in the impact of nutritional interventions between male and female might be related to the different age of puberty in the female population compared to the male population . in the age range of the present study female although , there is no nffp in big cities of iran , there are some programs for improving the nutritional status such as providing free milk in schools . a recent publication has shown that school feeding programs focus on milk supplementation had beneficial effects on the physical function and school performances specifically among girls in iran . the results of the mentioned study showed an improvement in the weight of children , psychological test 's scores and the grade - point average following this school feeding program . the intervention in the present study had focused on the snack intake in the school time . there are some reports regarding the nutrition transition in iran , which shows the importance of nutrition intervention to provide more healthy eating dietary habits among welfare groups of adolescents . hence , nutrition intervention especially in the form of nutrition education is needed in big cities and among welfare children and adolescents . although a study among iranian adolescents showed that dietary behavior of adolescents does not accord to their knowledge , which emphasize on the necessity of community intervention programs . a recent study regarding the major dietary pattern among iranian children showed the presence of four major dietary patterns , in which fast food pattern and sweet pattern as two major dietary patterns can be mentioned among iranian children . in advocacy program audience 's analysis accordingly , one of the prominent strategies in this study was working with media and was meeting with parent - teacher association that both of them were secondary target audiences . we also took into account policy makers in different levels , from national to local as primary audiences . advocacy team had several meetings with management and planning organization at national level and education organization of the fars province as well as principal of the targeted schools . providing nutritious snacks need contribution of private sector such as food industries or factories , but their benefits should be warranted . another choice was community involvement ; which can be achieved by female health volunteers who are working with the health system . advocacy team by using the support of charities and female health volunteers could establish a local factory that produced student 's snacks based on the new definition . however , there are some challenges on the way of expanding this program . mass production of the proposed snacks according to different desires and cultures and getting involvement of food industries with respect to marketing issues is one of those challenges . moreover , providing a supportive environment in order to change the food habits of the students and their parents among the wide range of the population require a sustainable and continuous inter - sector collaboration . although in a limited number of schools , in our study , interventions and advocacy program was successful , expanding this model to another areas around the country depends on convincing the policy makers at national level . in this regard , advocacy team should prepare evidenced based profile and transitional planning to convince the policy makers for improving the rule and regulation of nffp . the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight , obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention . assessing the dietary adherence is very important in nutrition intervention among population . as this population was children and adolescents we had a limitation in the blood sample collection to assess the subject 's dietary adherence . furthermore , this intervention was only focused on the intake of snack in school time and we did not have comprehensive information on the dietary intake of children and adolescents after school all over the day . the investigators propose further investigation in different areas of the country based on socio - cultural differences in order to make necessary modification and adapt this model to other areas . regarding the nutritional needs of the school age children , provision of a good platform for implementing and expanding this efficient model to the whole country based upon the socio - economic situation of each region is advisable to the moh and the moe .\",\n",

       "[\"aptamers are short single - stranded oligomers made up of dna , rna , or peptides that are capable of binding a target ligand ( proteins , small molecules , or even living cells ) with high affinity . they are also known as artificial antibodies because in addition to binding with high affinity , they also bind with high specificity . aptamers have several advantages over antibodies , including ease and low cost of production which does not involve animals . aptamers are less immunogenic than antibodies and are already being used as therapeutic agents in humans . nucleic acid aptamers , unlike antibodies , can be selected for and used under nonphysiological conditions , such as high - salt conditions and varying ph . also , nucleic acid aptamers are able to undergo specific conformational changes that antibodies can not . for example , nucleic acid aptamer binding can be  turned off  by the addition of the complementary strand . additionally , nucleic acid aptamers can undergo a conformational change when binding to their target and can be used as molecular beacons , fluorescently  off  when unbound and  on  when bound . the field of aptamers is rapidly growing as is the number of applications for their use .   nucleic acid aptamers are  evolved  from random sequences of dna / rna by a process known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment ( selex ) . the selex procedure involves the use of the random library of dna / rna sequences being incubated with the target , followed by a partitioning step to remove unbound sequences , an elution step to recover the binding sequences , and then an amplification step to generate a library of sequences enriched for binding . the selex procedure generally takes months to complete , with a typical selection requiring 10 or more rounds before completion . also , traditional selex requires a support for the target ( magnetic beads , membranes , etc . ) to bind with . the supports themselves can be targets for selection , and often rounds of negative selection must be done to avoid aptamers for the support .   use of capillary electrophoresis ( ce ) allows for selex to be performed in a much shorter amount of time due to much more efficient partitioning and without the aptamers binding to the ligand support ( the ligand flows freely in buffer , there is no support ) . in as little as one round of selection , and generally less than five rounds of selection ce - selex is a new technology first developed for use in 2004 and has yet to be commonly used . one of the main advantages to ce - selex over traditional selex is that the aptamer - target complex can be detected in the first round of selection . this early detection contrasts traditional selex , where several rounds must be done before being able to detect any dna . most ce - selex is done with laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) to increase the detection sensitivity to the analyzed samples . using ce with lif , a laser excites fluorescently labeled samples passing through the glass capillary tube which then emits light that is captured by an on - board detector attached to the ce machine itself .   we have developed a technique for selection of dna aptamers using ce but without the need for an on - board laser / detector system . the system takes advantage of real - time polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) . rt - pcr is able to sensitively detect dna - target complexes early in the selection procedure with an efficacy greater than that of traditional selex and equal to that of ce - selex with lif . we believe that this system could be beneficial for researchers that have access to ce , but do not have access to ce with lif , and are seeking to perform ce - selex . the protein that we chose to use as a target for aptamer selection was bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) . bsa is widely used for stabilization of enzymes , preventing enzymes of interest from adhering to tubes or pipettes , or as a protein comparison standard . there are several advantages to using bsa in that it is relatively stable , abundantly available from cow 's blood , and is of low cost . due to the low cost and high abundance of bsa , we chose it to serve as the protein target for our rt - pcr - coupled selection system . here , we report the isolation of a dna aptamer with specificity for bsa using the rt - pcr coupled capillary electrophoresis selection system .\",\n",
       " 'the target protein of interest , bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) , was purchased as a lyophilized powder through sigma - aldrich and was greater than 98% pure . the bsa was dissolved in rb1 buffer ( 50  mm tris - hcl , ph 8.2 ) and stored at 4c at a stock concentration of 1  mm . the dna library was purchased from alpha dna and contained a sequence of 5_cttctgcccgcctccttcc-(n)36-gacgagataggcggacact_3 ( 36 random nucleotides flanked by two - fixed 19 base regions used later as primers for pcr amplification ) . the protocol for selex using capillary electrophoresis ( ce ) was essentially as described earlier   but with a few modifications . the initial bulk affinity assay was performed with 50  m bsa and 25  m dna in order to view any dna - protein complexes and determine the collection window . capillary electrophoresis was done using a beckman coulter proteomelab pa 800 with a photon diode array ( pda ) capable of reading wavelengths in the uv range ( 10  nm400  nm ) . separation was done at a voltage of 10  kv and with 0  psi of pressure , except that during timed fraction collection the machine automatically reaches 0.1  psi of pressure . after determination of the collection window based on the bulk affinity analysis , the first round of selection began . the initial in vitro selection procedure involved 500  nm bsa and 3.3  m dna . the dna library ( 0.3  l at 100  m ) was mixed with 0.3  l of sb3 ( 100  mm tris - hcl at ph 8.2 , 200  mm nacl , and 10  mm mgcl2 ) for a final concentration of 50 m dna library , 50  mm tris - hcl at ph 8.2 , 100  mm nacl , and 5  mm mgcl2 . this mixture was heated in the biorad icycler to 94c for 1 minute and then cooled to 20c at a rate of 0.5c per second . after the folding of the dna library , 5  l of 1  m bsa dissolved in rb1 buffer was added , and additional run buffer was added to make the final volume 10  l . this brought the final concentrations to 3.3  m dna library , 500  nm bsa , 6  mm nacl , 300  m mgcl2 , and 50  mm tris - hcl ( ph 8.2 ) . after each round of selection , fractions were analyzed through real - time pcr ( rt - pcr ) using the abi stepone plus . rt - pcr was done with two primers : the forward aptamer - amplifying primer p1 ( 5_cttctgcccgcctccttcc_3 ) and the reverse primer p2 ( 5_agtgtccgcctatctcgtc_3 ) , respectively . the primers were designed using oligoanalyzer ( http://www.idtdna.com/analyzer/applications/oligoanalyzer/ ) to limit complementarity to each other , in order to decrease nonspecific amplification of self - dimerizing primers . for amplification , 20  l of pcr mix was prepared consisting of 10  l of 2x quanta sybr green pcr master mix ( roche ) , 0.6  l of 10  m p1 , 0.6  l of 10  m p2 , 1  l of collected fraction as template , and 7.8  l h2o . following rt - pcr , the fraction containing the complex was amplified using standard pcr . pcr was done in a 100  l volume consisting of 1  l of 5  u/l ex taq polymerase from takara , 3  l of 10  m forward primer p1 , 3  l of 10  m reverse primer p2 , 10  l of 10x mg buffer ( takara ex taq ) , 8  l of 2.5  mm each dntp , and 5  l of the collected fraction from capillary electrophoresis . pcr was done using primer p1 and p2 as noted previously , except that the number of cycles for pcr amplification was based on 50% of the maximum yield as determined by rt - pcr . the biotin - labeled primer was used subsequent to pcr in order to separate the strand of interest and the nonaptamer strand after pcr . magnetic beads with streptavidin coating from bangs laboratories ( biomag nuclease - free streptavidin ) were used to bind the biotin - labeled dna . strands were separated with 10  mm naoh after three washes with wash buffer ( 10  mm tris - hcl at ph 8 with 500  mm nacl and 1  mm edta ) . post - selection dna cloning of the aptamer pool was done with the zero blunt topo pcr cloning kit ( invitrogen ) . standard pcr with unlabeled primers p1 and p2 was used to generate double - stranded dna containing the aptamer sequence , which was then blunt - end ligated into the pcr - blunt ii - topo vector that contains the kanamycin resistance gene . colonies were selected for growth on kanamycin - containing media ( kanamycin final concentration was 40  g / ml ) , and plasmid dna was isolated using the genejet plasmid miniprep kit ( fermentas ) . asymmetric pcr with unlabeled primers p1 and p2 was used on the plasmid dna to predominately generate the strand of interest which was then analyzed using ce and rt - pcr . twelve colonies were pooled into a group and each group was assayed for bsa binding using ce . individual plasmids from each pooled group that showed binding were sequenced by eurofins mwg operon . based on sequencing results , additionally , mfold ( http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/dna-folding-form ) was used on each candidate aptamer to identify secondary structure . potential aptamer oligonucleotides and a negative control oligonucleotide were 5 labeled with p32 -atp using t4 polynucleotide kinase ( new england biolabs ) . the negative control consisted of an oligonucleotide of the same length as the random dna library oligonucleotides ( 74 bases ) , contained the same flanking primer regions , and had a fixed sequence for its internal region 5-cttctgcccgcctccttccggtcgggcacacctgtcatacccaatctcgaggccagacgagataggcggacact-3. the internal region was chosen using a random dna sequence generator with a specified gc content of 50% ( http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~mmaduro/random.htm ) . the binding conditions for the initial emsa were done by adding equal amounts of sb3 buffer to the labeled oligonucleotides ( 20,000  cpm equivalent ) and incubating at 94c for 1 minute in a pcr machine and a gradual cooling to 20c at a rate of 0.5c per second ( total time taken is ~4 minutes ) . bsa stock of 1  mm was made in rb1 buffer ( the run buffer used in the ce - selex protocol ) . different dilutions of bsa , as required for assessing aptamer binding , were also made in rb1 buffer . with fixed concentration of the p32-labeled candidate aptamer , the concentration of the ligand ( bsa ) was varied from 50 to 800  m .   the buffer used for binding was a 6x buffer consisting of 600  mm ammonium chloride , 300  mm potassium chloride , 30  mm sodium chloride , 120  mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 , 30% glycerol , and bromophenol blue ( bpb ) 0.25% . the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes after which 1.5  l of 10x loading buffer ( 200  mm tris - hcl ph 8.2 , 50% glycerol , and bpb 0.25% ) was added and the reaction was left on ice for 515 minutes before loading into the gel . minigels were made with stock solutions of 40% acrylamide / bis - acrylamide ( 29  :  1 ) , 1x tris - borate edta ( tbe ) , 10% ammonium persulfate ( aps ) , and tetramethylethylenediamine ( temed ) . prerun was done in 1x tbe buffer for 1 hour prior to loading of the samples . the samples were run at 150  v until the bromophenol blue dye reached the bottom of the gel . the radioactivity in the gel was analyzed by phosphor imager ( molecular dynamics - typhoon trio imager ) . apart from the above - mentioned 6x buffer , an additional 5x binding buffer containing 100  mm tris - hcl ph 8.5 , 250  mm nacl , 10  mm mgcl2 , 10  mm zncl2 , and 10% glycerol was added in the incubation mixture . furthermore , the radiolabeled oligonucleotides were added directly to the incubation mixture and not heated to 94c as done previously . samples were left on ice for 515 minutes before being loaded into the 4% nondenaturing gels which had been prerun for 1 hour in 1x tbe as described previously . increasing concentrations of the specific unlabeled oligonucleotide were added during incubation of the bsa - aptamer complex ( conditions described previously ) . three different amounts ( 1.25 , 2.5 , and 5  pmol ) were used . complex formation was allowed to go on for 30 minutes at room temperature before the radioactively labeled oligonucleotide was added and the incubation was continued for another hour and 30 minutes . in the control sample , all the conditions were similar except for the absence of the unlabeled competing oligonucleotide .   emsas were set up using 4  g of the anti - bsa polyclonal antibody ( obtained from invitrogen ) . essentially , the antibody ( 4  g ) was mixed with bsa ( 500  m ) along with the 5x binding buffer and left on ice for 1 hour . the radioactively labeled i1 - 5 aptamer and the 6x buffer were added next and the incubation continued for 1 hour and 30 minutes at room temperature before stopping the incubation by leaving the samples on ice for 515 minutes .',\n",
       " \"the general scheme of rt - pcr coupled ce - selex is shown in figure 1 . to test the concept that aptamer selection with ce - selex and rt - pcr could be feasible , we first began by calibrating the capillary electrophoresis ( ce ) machine . the ce machine used , the proteomelab pa 800 , is incapable of running solutions that contain high concentrations of salts . due to this limitation , our buffers had to be tested to find the proper salt balance to ensure that the machine did not fail but at the same time had enough salt to stabilize our aptamer structures . therefore , the buffer condition used for the initial step of folding the dna library was done in a high - salt buffer ( 50  mm tris - hcl at ph 8.2 , 100  mm nacl , and 5  mm mgcl2 ) followed by incubation and running the folded dna library in low - salt concentrations ( 50  mm tris - hcl at ph 8.2 , 6  mm nacl , and 300  nm mgcl2 ) to ensure both proper folding and running of the dna library . although the low - salt problem may have excluded many potential binders to bsa , low - salt concentrations actually mirror the physiological conditions more accurately since the cellular level of magnesium is only ~1 - 2  mm . after optimizing for the salt concentrations , we used ce and ran a large amount ( 100  m ) of bsa alone in order to visualize the free protein peak run timing . next , we performed the same analysis using a large ( 3  m ) amount of dna alone .   once the individual free protein and free dna run times were established , we proceeded to combine bsa and dna for a bulk affinity analysis ( figure 2 ) . the bulk affinity analysis allowed us to visualize peaks for the free bsa and the free dna in combination , and this information was used to determine the collection window . the ce machine used was the proteomelab pa 800 from beckman coulter , which did not have laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) . to sensitively detect protein - dna complexes between the free dna and free protein , we relied on rt - pcr . the collection window started from the end of the free - protein peak to the start of the free - dna peak ( figure 3(a ) ) . the seven fractions , instead of just one fraction , allowed us to analyze with greater precision the region of the dna - protein complex . unlike the bulk affinity assay in which 100  m bsa was used , for the selection , the concentration of bsa was reduced to 500  nm in order to increase the stringency of selection . in the first round of selection , the initial collected fraction of dna detected by rt - pcr needed 36 cycles of amplification to reach 50% of the maximum yield , the midpoint cycle , of pcr ( figure 3(a ) ) . the second fraction analyzed had a higher amount of dna compared to the first fraction collected , taking only 34 cycles of amplification to reach the midpoint cycle . the amount of dna collected for the third and fourth fractions was lower than that of the second fraction collected . the fifth fraction collected showed a marked increase in dna indicative of the beginning of the free - dna peak and so this fraction was not used . the pattern detected by rt - pcr implied a dna - protein complex present in the second fraction collected since this fraction was collected by ce after the free protein peak , but well before the free - dna peak .   the collected dna containing the supposed dna - protein complex was rt - pcr amplified using primers flanking the internal random sequence . the forward primer , p1 , amplified the aptamer - containing strand of interest , while the reverse primer , p2 , amplified the nonaptamer complementary strand . in a previous protocol to select dna aptamers , it was shown that overamplification of the random library leads to formation of nonspecific products , therefore the random library was only amplified to ~50% of the maximum yield as measured by rt - pcr . after rt - pcr analysis revealed the optimum number of cycles to amplify the collected dna , a regular pcr using more of the collected dna was performed . in this regular pcr , the p2 primer was labeled at its 5 end with biotin while p1 had no modifications . after the pcr , the dna products were attached to streptavidin - coated beads due to the strong interaction between the streptavidin on the beads and the biotin - labeled primer p2 . after immobilization on the beads and several washing steps , the forward aptamer - containing strand was released from the complementary strand by incubation with 10  mm naoh . after this step , the binding of the new aptamer pool was analyzed using ce and rt - pcr .   to assess the binding of the newly generated aptamer pool to the target , two separate ce runs were done , one with a 200-fold molar excess of bsa used for the first round of selection ( 100  m ) ( figure 3(b ) ) and another without any bsa ( figure 3(c ) ) . based upon these ce test runs , it was clear that the second fraction collected in round one of ce - selex did show binding to bsa . the aptamer pool ( 5  l of the collected fraction ) was then subjected to another round of selection . selection continued until the fourth round ; at which point rt - pcr did not show any change in the amount of dna at the complex and we did not continue with any further rounds of selection .   potential aptamers collected during the third round of selection were again amplified and then used for cloning . instead of amplifying with a biotin - labeled p2 primer , the potential aptamers were amplified with a nonlabeled p2 primer since the biotin label at the 5 end of the dna might interfere with ligation during cloning . topo blunt - end cloning was performed with the aptamer pool and colonies were selected by growth on lb plus kanamycin plates . two hundred colonies were selected and analyzed for bsa binding using ce and rt - pcr . groups of 12 colonies were combined in order to facilitate faster analysis . in order to amplify the aptamer strand from the vector with the aptamer insert , asymmetric pcr was performed using a 10-fold excess of the aptamer strand primer . four groups : i1 , r2 , g2 , and o3 showed stronger binding than the others by rt - pcr and then the individual clones from these groups were sequenced .   after sequencing , in order to confirm that the potential aptamer sequences were binding to bsa , salt - free oligonucleotides containing the potential aptamer sequences were used in emsa gels . emsas work on the principle that dna bound in a dna - target complex will run slower than free dna . the free dna will appear at the bottom of the gel , while the dna bound in the dna - target complex will be shifted higher up in the gel . the potential aptamers , as well as a negative control ( described in section 1 ) , were initially screened with a set of binding conditions similar to that of the ce experiments . only those sequences that were 76 or 75 bases in length , and identical or almost identical in length to the original library length of 76 bases , were ordered and subsequently screened by emsa . the candidate aptamer sequences were analyzed in silico by using clustalw2 and mfold , but no consensus sequence or specific secondary structure between the sequences was found . of the initial group of oligonucleotides screened by emsa , the i1 group , one member of this group of potential aptamers , i1 - 5 , did bind to bsa and a distinct bound complex could be visualized at 500 and 800  m bsa in the initial emsa ( figure 4(a ) ) . also in the initial emsa , at higher concentrations of bsa ( > 500  m ) , a faint band could be seen . this band was considered a nonspecific complex because both the negative control and the i1 - 5 aptamer had this band . in this emsa , and in all subsequent emsas , the appearance of radiolabeled dna at the top of each lane , in the well , can be seen . the dna at the top of the lanes is caused due to the single - stranded nature of the dna . the single - stranded dna is capable of forming aggregates with itself and with the loading dye . the size of these aggregates prevents the dna from entering the gel and thus it remains in the well . after the initial emsa modeled after the ce experiments , binding conditions were changed to include higher salt conditions that were not possible to run with the proteomelab pa 800 . in addition to buffer conditions , we also did not subject the aptamers to the heating at 94c prior to incubation . again the potential aptamer i1 - 5 showed a bound complex using these modified binding conditions ( figure 4(b ) ) . after the initial screen for potential aptamers with the i1 group , a subsequent screen using oligos from the g2 group and the modified emsa conditions revealed several additional aptamers for bsa ( figure 5 ) . the list of the potential aptamers ' sequences ordered is shown in table 2 , among these aptamers , i1 - 5 was chosen for further characterization . only the i1 - 5 oligonucleotide was further pursued as it was the first aptamer discovered by the screen that consistently showed binding ability to bsa in the ce - selex as well as under the two different emsa conditions . to further confirm the specificity of this aptamer to bsa , a supershift assay using an antibody to bsa was performed . in the presence of 4  g of the anti - bsa polyclonal antibody , the binding capacity was reduced as seen by an appreciable reduction in the intensity of the radioactive oligo banding pattern ( figure 6 ) . this supports the idea that the anti - bsa polyclonal antibody and the bsa aptamer i1 - 5 recognize the same epitope . a similar pattern of banding was reported for the human neurofilament mrna binding to superoxide dismutase1 ( sod1 ) in a supershift assay . also , competition assays were performed by incubating bsa with an excess of unlabeled i1 - 5 aptamer of three different amounts ( 1.25 , 2.5 , and 5  pmoles ) before the addition of the labeled i1 - 5 oligo . the bsa - aptamer bound complex was abolished in the presence of higher amounts of the unlabeled competitor ( figure 7 ) . although by emsa the i1 - 5 aptamer showed low binding affinity to bsa , the cold - competitor assay , as well as the supershift assay indicated that a specific interaction was occurring between bsa and the i1 - 5 aptamer , thus supporting the effectiveness of rt - pcr coupled ce - selex .\",\n",
       " \"the general scheme of rt - pcr coupled ce - selex is shown in figure 1 . to test the concept that aptamer selection with ce - selex and rt - pcr could be feasible , we first began by calibrating the capillary electrophoresis ( ce ) machine . the ce machine used , the proteomelab pa 800 , is incapable of running solutions that contain high concentrations of salts . due to this limitation , our buffers had to be tested to find the proper salt balance to ensure that the machine did not fail but at the same time had enough salt to stabilize our aptamer structures . therefore , the buffer condition used for the initial step of folding the dna library was done in a high - salt buffer ( 50  mm tris - hcl at ph 8.2 , 100  mm nacl , and 5  mm mgcl2 ) followed by incubation and running the folded dna library in low - salt concentrations ( 50  mm tris - hcl at ph 8.2 , 6  mm nacl , and 300  nm mgcl2 ) to ensure both proper folding and running of the dna library . although the low - salt problem may have excluded many potential binders to bsa , low - salt concentrations actually mirror the physiological conditions more accurately since the cellular level of magnesium is only ~1 - 2  mm . after optimizing for the salt concentrations , we used ce and ran a large amount ( 100  m ) of bsa alone in order to visualize the free protein peak run timing . next , we performed the same analysis using a large ( 3  m ) amount of dna alone .   once the individual free protein and free dna run times were established , we proceeded to combine bsa and dna for a bulk affinity analysis ( figure 2 ) . the bulk affinity analysis allowed us to visualize peaks for the free bsa and the free dna in combination , and this information was used to determine the collection window . the ce machine used was the proteomelab pa 800 from beckman coulter , which did not have laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) . to sensitively detect protein - dna complexes between the free dna and free protein , we relied on rt - pcr . the collection window started from the end of the free - protein peak to the start of the free - dna peak ( figure 3(a ) ) . the seven fractions , instead of just one fraction , allowed us to analyze with greater precision the region of the dna - protein complex . unlike the bulk affinity assay in which 100  m bsa was used , for the selection , the concentration of bsa was reduced to 500  nm in order to increase the stringency of selection . in the first round of selection , the initial collected fraction of dna detected by rt - pcr needed 36 cycles of amplification to reach 50% of the maximum yield , the midpoint cycle , of pcr ( figure 3(a ) ) . the second fraction analyzed had a higher amount of dna compared to the first fraction collected , taking only 34 cycles of amplification to reach the midpoint cycle . the amount of dna collected for the third and fourth fractions was lower than that of the second fraction collected . the fifth fraction collected showed a marked increase in dna indicative of the beginning of the free - dna peak and so this fraction was not used . the pattern detected by rt - pcr implied a dna - protein complex present in the second fraction collected since this fraction was collected by ce after the free protein peak , but well before the free - dna peak .   the collected dna containing the supposed dna - protein complex was rt - pcr amplified using primers flanking the internal random sequence . the forward primer , p1 , amplified the aptamer - containing strand of interest , while the reverse primer , p2 , amplified the nonaptamer complementary strand . in a previous protocol to select dna aptamers , it was shown that overamplification of the random library leads to formation of nonspecific products , therefore the random library was only amplified to ~50% of the maximum yield as measured by rt - pcr . after rt - pcr analysis revealed the optimum number of cycles to amplify the collected dna , a regular pcr using more of the collected dna was performed . in this regular pcr , the p2 primer was labeled at its 5 end with biotin while p1 had no modifications . after the pcr , the dna products were attached to streptavidin - coated beads due to the strong interaction between the streptavidin on the beads and the biotin - labeled primer p2 . after immobilization on the beads and several washing steps , the forward aptamer - containing strand was released from the complementary strand by incubation with 10  mm naoh . after this step , the binding of the new aptamer pool was analyzed using ce and rt - pcr .   to assess the binding of the newly generated aptamer pool to the target , two separate ce runs were done , one with a 200-fold molar excess of bsa used for the first round of selection ( 100  m ) ( figure 3(b ) ) and another without any bsa ( figure 3(c ) ) . based upon these ce test runs , it was clear that the second fraction collected in round one of ce - selex did show binding to bsa . the aptamer pool ( 5  l of the collected fraction ) was then subjected to another round of selection . selection continued until the fourth round ; at which point rt - pcr did not show any change in the amount of dna at the complex and we did not continue with any further rounds of selection .   potential aptamers collected during the third round of selection were again amplified and then used for cloning . instead of amplifying with a biotin - labeled p2 primer , the potential aptamers were amplified with a nonlabeled p2 primer since the biotin label at the 5 end of the dna might interfere with ligation during cloning . topo blunt - end cloning was performed with the aptamer pool and colonies were selected by growth on lb plus kanamycin plates . two hundred colonies were selected and analyzed for bsa binding using ce and rt -

5 was chosen for further characterization . only the i1 - 5 oligonucleotide was further pursued as it was the first aptamer discovered by the screen that consistently showed binding ability to bsa in the ce - selex as well as under the two different emsa conditions . to further confirm the specificity of this aptamer to bsa , a supershift assay using an antibody to bsa was performed . in the presence of 4  g of the anti - bsa polyclonal antibody , the binding capacity was reduced as seen by an appreciable reduction in the intensity of the radioactive oligo banding pattern ( figure 6 ) . this supports the idea that the anti - bsa polyclonal antibody and the bsa aptamer i1 - 5 recognize the same epitope . a similar pattern of banding was reported for the human neurofilament mrna binding to superoxide dismutase1 ( sod1 ) in a supershift assay . also , competition assays were performed by incubating bsa with an excess of unlabeled i1 - 5 aptamer of three different amounts ( 1.25 , 2.5 , and 5  pmoles ) before the addition of the labeled i1 - 5 oligo . the bsa - aptamer bound complex was abolished in the presence of higher amounts of the unlabeled competitor ( figure 7 ) . although by emsa the i1 - 5 aptamer showed low binding affinity to bsa , the cold - competitor assay , as well as the supershift assay indicated that a specific interaction was occurring between bsa and the i1 - 5 aptamer , thus supporting the effectiveness of rt - pcr coupled ce - selex . the conclusion drawn from our studies is that we have been able to generate an aptamer for bsa with appreciable specificity in a few rounds of selection from a random library of dna oligonucleotides .   the protocol described here is very efficient compared to the traditional selex which takes much more time and reagents . as noted previously , traditional selex makes use of a solid support to which the target must be bound . the coupling of the target to the support is not completely efficient and often much of the target remains unbound and washed away . using ce - selex , there is no need for a solid support and because of the small size of the capillary a much smaller amount of target is required . even though ce - selex is much more efficient than traditional selex , ce - selex still requires additional equipment ( lif ) beyond the standard capillary electrophoresis machine . ce is not restricted to the isolation of aptamers , and while many labs may have a ce machine , much fewer will have one with lif . rt - pcr and lif both work under the principle of fluorescence . very sensitively and directly , rt - pcr has the potential to be more sensitive because unlike lif , which directly detects the fluorescent signal , rt - pcr can amplify the signal . by amplifying a signal undetectable by lif , dna - target complexes that would have been missed by lif taken together the efficiency , time , and sensitivity of the protocol for dna aptamer selection by coupling ce - selex with rt - pcr described here can benefit other researchers that are also interested in selecting for aptamers and would like to use ce - selex , but are unable to do so for lack of lif .   bsa was chosen to test our rt - pcr - coupled selection system , but the bsa aptamer we selected may be beneficial itself . due to the high amount of bsa used in many biochemical assays , sometimes the amount of bsa present in a mixture of proteins obscures accurate readings of proteins of interest . it would be useful to have a way to deplete this unwanted bsa from a reaction . also , bsa can be allergenic   and in certain situations it might be beneficial to detect small amounts of bsa contaminant present in cow 's milk . currently , antibodies to bsa provide an answer to these issues , but as previously mentioned , there are several advantages to using aptamers over antibodies .\"]"

       "['it is well known that job stress is responsible for poor work performance , high absenteeism , less work productivity , and several diseases.15 recently , results from thirteen independent cohort studies in europe indicated that job strain is responsible for coronary heart disease , as are lifestyle and orthodox risk factors.6 the population s attributable risk for job strain was 3.4% , which is lower than that for smoking habits ( 36% ) , abdominal obesity ( 20% ) , and physical inactivity ( 12% ) . however , the interheart study7 showed that work stress doubled the risk of coronary heart disease . in finland , the increase in job strain was associated with an increase in the risk of requiring a disability pension . moreover , as regarding men , a positive association between cardiovascular diseases and an increased risk of disability pension was found.8 mental health caused disabling conditions in 9% of the population in the uk , and estimations for the 20012002 prevalence of self - reported illness caused or made worse by work classified stress , depression , or anxiety as the second most commonly reported illness.9 within this context , in 2010 , in italy , a governmental commission published several indications for the evaluation of stress . the commission identified a preliminary phase and a second phase for in - depth examination . instruments for self - evaluation such as psychometric tests are recommended during the second phase . in this context of changes in the cultural and legislative background , the authors have taken the opportunity to contribute to the development of models for the identification and assessment of stress , responding to the demand for specific measurement instruments . data from the literature as well as normative requirements suggest the need for methods for the early identification of stress in workers . some instruments have already been developed , such as the job content questionnaire,1012 the work organization assessment questionnaire,13 and the effort  reward imbalance questionnaire.14,15 these instruments are considered complementary sources since they are based on different concepts of the work - related stress . they are mainly focused on measuring the job climate , the facets of job organization , or the balance between effort and reward , but an in - depth examination of individual resources and capabilities is lacking . newman and beehr16 underlined that job stress is a situation wherein job - related factors interact with the worker to change his / her psychological and/or physiological condition , forcing a person to deviate from normal functioning . from this viewpoint , the focus is not the stressful situation or the subjective perception , but the interaction between these two components . in agreement with this rationale , we developed a new multidimensional instrument called the maugeri stress index ( masi ) designed to investigate individual resources for coping with stressful situations on the job . the instrument was developed for an in - depth examination , but it is also usable in the preliminary phase and for monitoring homogeneous groups of workers when individual resources play a critical role in coping with the demands arising from organizational changes . this group of workers represents a category particularly at risk for the development of job stress , and for this reason they can be considered a representative sample of the target population . the first version was tested on a restricted sample ( n=329 ) and has already been published with some clinical qualities and some limitations.17 the aims of this study were to develop a shorter form of the questionnaire using an item reduction procedure and to assess the psychometric properties of the resulting instrument using the rasch measurement model .',\n",
       " 'the masi ( figure s1 ) requires participants to express their level of agreement with 51 items on a five - point likert scale ( never , little , enough , much , very much ) . the questionnaire is composed of four main scales including 47 items : wellness ( eleven items ) , resilience ( 20 items ) , perception of social support ( nine items ) , and negative coping styles ( seven items ) . further , a lie scale ( four items ) is included . a high score on the index shows perceived eustress . previously , giorgi et al17 studied the dimensionality of the instrument by using exploratory factor analysis . in the study here presented , we analyzed the internal consistency of the masi and its factorial structure by using structural equation models ( sems).18 therefore , starting with these results , we developed a reduced form of the instrument , the maugeri stress index  reduced form ( masi - r ) , which is described in this paper . the psychometric properties of the masi - r are analyzed using the rasch measurement model.19 the scientific and technical committee ( irb ) of the care and research institute of tradate ( varese , italy ) , salvatore maugeri foundation irccs , discussed and approved the study ( 5/5/2015 cod . the sample comprised 1,182 participants ( females : 57.6% ; males : 42.4% ) with a mean age of 45.7 years ( standard deviation = 9.0 ) . other subjects engaged in the study were factory workers ( 15.1% ) , teachers ( 4.6% ) , and managers ( 4.2% ) . of the sample , 93.9% had a permanent work contract and 38.0% were shift workers . all the participants filled in the questionnaire voluntarily after a short motivational presentation made by a psychologist . each participant provided written informed consent for the use of data in anonymous form . participants who omitted at least 25% of responses ( 13 items ) were not considered in the analysis . therefore , seven subjects were removed , and 1,175 units were used for analysis . regarding sem analysis , the remaining missing data were replaced by the mean of the responses for each item . by contrast , for the rasch analysis , only the complete cases were considered , leading to a total sample of 904 subjects . the confirmatory factor analysis was used to test and improve the fit of the data for the hypothesized four - factor model ( see  missing data  section ) . the confirmatory factor analysis is part of the general methodology of the sem and allows us to test causal relations between latent and observed variables . the analysis was started by building an independence model , assuming uncorrelated latent factors . as a second step , we tested the presence of relations between the latent factors , performing a model comparison . step by step , we imposed covariance relations among factors , looking for an improvement in the fit . a similar methodology was applied to select the items in order to reduce their number and to simplify the instrument . to make model comparisons , we used the akaike information criterion ( aic)20 and the bayesian information criterion ( bic)21 to identify which model was better.22,23 since the best model has the lowest indices , we compared the information criteria of a complex model with those of the simpler one , obtaining two differences : aic and bic . a negative difference indicates that the complex model is better than the simpler one ; a difference of bic 2 is generally accepted as positive evidence for the difference between two models.24 in contrast to the aic , the bic penalizes greatly complex models : a very complex model would have to improve the fit substantially in order for bic to choose it as the best . the item properties were analyzed using the partial credit model,25 a polytomous formulation of the rasch model . the rasch model is a well - known one - parameter logistic model , commonly applied for the evaluation of the properties of a unidimensional psychometric test with an ordinal response scale . it assumes that the probability of a person producing a positive outcome to an item depends on the distance between the person s ability and the item s difficulty . in contrast to the classical test theory and the sem approach , the rasch model is centered on the study of items and their properties . the model tests the calibration of the instrument on a population , putting persons abilities and item difficulties into the same scale . it can distinguish between the easiest and hardest items and evaluate if the instrument leads to a reliable measure of the latent trait . the scales of the masi were studied separately , fitting one partial credit model for each scale . the reliability was evaluated using the separation index g for persons ( gp ) and items ( gi ) and the person separation reliability r , which corresponds to cronbach s .26 a high variability in persons abilities and in item difficulties is necessary so that the measurement is reliable . gp quantifies the number of strata of abilities that the instrument can separate and identify as different ; a low value ( gp < 2 ) is a sign that the instrument may not be sensitive enough to distinguish between individuals with high and low performance abilities.27 by contrast , a low gi value ( gi <3 ) indicates that either the variance of item difficulties is too small or the sample is not large enough . item properties have been evaluated using two popular indices:27 infit ( information - weighted fit ) and outfit ( outlier - sensitive fit ) . both indices are calculated based on the mean square of standardized residuals for items , but outfit is more sensitive to outliers than infit . acceptable values range between 0.6 and 1.4;28 lower values indicate underfit ( ie , the presence of unexplained variance ) and higher values indicate overfit ( ie , redundancy in the set of items ) . the unidimensionality of each scale was assessed by evaluating the strength of correlations between residuals and the results of the principal component analysis performed on the residuals.29 since the rasch analysis extracts the first , and theoretically , the only latent component within each scale , residuals should be constituted only by random noise . a simple rule of thumb27 is that if the residuals are constituted by pure random noise , the eigenvalue of the first extracted component must be less than 2 ( ie , a strength of less than two items ) . furthermore , we used the martin - lf test,30 which splits the scale into two clusters of items on the basis of the median difficulty and performs a likelihood ratio test . analyses were performed in the r environment,31 using the packages lavaan 0.51132 for the confirmatory factor analysis and erm 0.15033 for the rasch analysis .',\n",
       " 'the internal consistency , measured by the cronbach s  , appeared good for the scales wellness ( =0.94 ) and resilience ( =0.89 ) . in contrast , for the scales perception of social support ( =0.64 ) and negative coping styles ( =0.65 ) , the values were not so good , although they were acceptable . we considered the correlation between each item and the total score of the respective scale ( calculated excluding the target item ) . within the scale of perception of social support these items were : 4 , 13 , 17 , and 28 ( the content of items are reported in figure s1 ) . whereas the item - total correlation for items 4 and 28 were near 0.3 , the indices for items 13 and 17 were lower than 0.2 . the most problematic item was 13 , because the cronbach s  of the respective scale increased if this item was deleted . we observed a medium - sized pearson s correlation between the scales resilience and wellness ( r=0.53 , p<0.001 ) and between resilience and perception of social support ( r=0.45 , p<0.001 ) . the confirmatory factor analysis started with the estimation of the independence model , assuming uncorrelated latent dimensions . all parameters were estimated to be significantly different from zero for p<0.001 . for the wellness scale , the standardized parameters ranged between 0.61 and 0.87 , while the values for the resilience scale were between 0.33 and 0.71 . in the perception of social support scale , the coefficients ranged between 0.11 and 0.66 ( item 13 was the only one that was significant for p<0.01 ) . finally , in the negative coping styles scale , the values ranged between 0.35 and 0.55 . the goodness - of - fit indices highlighted a poor fit ( comparative fit index [ cfi ] = 0.78 , nonnormed fit index [ nnfi ] = 0.77 , root mean squares error of approximation [ rmsea ] = 0.06 ) . therefore , we proceeded to free the covariance relations between the latent dimensions one by one , looking for an improvement . we released , in sequence , the covariance parameters for wellness , resilience , and perception of social support . in the last step , we freed the covariance relations with the negative coping styles scale at each step , the new model was compared with the previous one using the difference in aic and bic . the progressive deletion of constraints in covariance parameters improved the model ( cfi = 0.82 , nnfi = 0.81 , rmsea = 0.06 ) . in order to develop a short form of the masi as a first step , starting from the identified model in the  confirmatory factor analysis of the masi  section ( correlated factors ) , we deleted selected items one by one , looking for a better internal consistency . the candidate items for deletion were those with an item - total correlation of less than 0.3 and those that , if deleted , caused an increase in the cronbach . we deleted three items from the scale perception of social support ( 13 , 17 , and 4 ) , three items from the scale resilience ( 36 , 8 , and 22 ) , and two items from the negative coping styles scale ( 38 and 15 ) . the resulting model showed a better fit than the starting model ( cfi = 0.86 , nnfi = 0.85 , rmsea = 0.06 ) . as the second step , using sem , we tested the presence of covariance between errors . inspecting modification indices , we identified several candidate parameters to free , concentrating our attention on items with semantic similarities in content . one at a time , aic and bic showed an improvement of the fit for each step ; further , the final model showed better fit indices ( cfi = 0.89 , nnfi = 0.88 , rmsea = 0.05 ) than the starting one . since the semantic content of several items was very similar , we kept only one item from each pair , considering the relevance of the item in a clinical perspective as driving principle for the choice . competing items are reported in table 2 , with bold items being included in the final model . in one case ( 6s and 11s ) , we deleted both items , and in two cases , ( items 33 and 25 and items 29 and 39 ) we kept both items . the final model considered item 37 , marked in bold in figure s1 , which constitutes the short version of the tool , called masi - r . figure 1 is a graphical description of the model with estimated parameters ; fit indices indicate an acceptable fit with the data ( cfi = 0.88 , nnfi = 0.87 ) and a good error of approximation of the model ( rmsea = 0.05 ) . preliminarily , we evaluated the possible presence of a differential item functioning on the scales . using the regression approach , we tested the invariance of item scores across several clusters of subjects , taking into account the sex of participants , their age , the presence / absence of job shifts , and the length of service . for each scale , f - tests sometimes showed significant results at the 5% level , but the effect sizes were always very low (  < 0.05 ) . since the effect of these variables on the total scores was not noticeable , they were not considered significant . regarding the issue of reliability , the results of the analyses on the masi - r were similar to the results of the analyses on the masi . the person reliability appeared good for the scales wellness ( r=0.89 ) and resilience ( r=0.89 ) and were acceptable for the scales perception of social support ( r=0.70 ) and negative coping styles ( r=0.50 ) . in the two latter scales , the persons separation indices seemed critical : gp = 1.52 for perception of social support and gp = 0.99 for negative coping styles . in contrast , for the wellnesss ( gp = 2.87 ) and resilience ( gp = 2.79 ) scales , the persons separation indices were more adequate . both infit and outfit were always good ( table 3 ) and neither underfit nor overfit affected the items . figure 2 depicts the calibration of the instrument , comparing the distribution of the persons abilities and item difficulties along the logit scale . for each panel , the scores on the left side represent persons with high stress ( ie , low  ability  ) , while the right side represents persons with low stress ( ie , high  ability  ) . the matched distributions of persons abilities and item difficulties show that difficulties cover the abilities quite well . this is confirmed by the separation indices gi , for which the values are always good ( wellness : 15.10 , resilience : 6.80 , perception of social support : 11.01 , negative coping styles : 4.55 ) , showing that the variances of item difficulties are adequate for measuring latent dimensions because they cover the entire spectrum of each trait . finally , we tested the actual unidimensionality of the masi - r scales . for each one , all of the correlations between residuals were lower than 0.4 ( rarely did they exceed 0.3 ) . further , the eigenvalues estimated by the principal component analyses were always lower than 2 . moreover , the martin - lf test confirmed that no other components appeared to be present within the four scales :  values were never significant .',\n",
       " 'this paper presents the masi - r , a new psychometric instrument that aims to screen for job stress . the instrument is structured as a self - report questionnaire that is relatively short but psychometrically comprehensive . the masi - r allows us to obtain a reliable measure of exposure to workplace stress and its impact on workers . using four correlated subscales ( wellness , resilience , perception of social support , negative copying styles ) and a lie index , the questionnaire measures several dimensions that determine the total index . the total index can be obtained as the sum of responses ( coded from 1 to 5 ) . when the response pattern presents missing items , these values can be estimated by the mean of the provided responses . the masi - r originates from a reduction of the original longer masi , whose scales include an overall pool of 47 items . using an item selection procedure , we selected and removed those items that did not adequately contribute to the measurement . the structure of the instrument was further improved using an sem . the rasch model indicated good item properties with neither underfit , overfit , nor differential item functioning between population strata . furthermore , item difficulties covered the persons abilities quite well . the first one refers to a general condition of wellness , serenity , and satisfaction ; it is defined by the absence of negative symptoms and by the presence of optimism regarding the work experience . the resilience scale evaluates skills such as tenacity , flexibility , and the ability to deal with problems on the job . the other two scales have a restricted number of items . perception of social support explores a component that plays a fundamental role in stress and burnout , consisting of the perception of adequate support and assistance from colleagues and superiors.34 by contrast , the negative coping styles scale investigates the presence of social isolation , behavioral disengagement , anxiety , or irritability in reaction to stressor situations . for both scales this was probably due to the small number of items included in the scales , but it might also indicate a restricted ability range within the selected sample.27 the masi - r assumes stress as a general and unidimensional latent factor that shows itself in a broad spectrum of facets . these facets are clustered in the four identified components . according to this point of view , the correlation between the four latent traits suggests that the number of items could be further reduced and the total score could be used as a uniform one - factorial measure . recently , a study regarding the discriminant validity of the masi - r was published35 and the results show that workers exposed to workplace mobbing showed higher work stress levels compared to the control group in all aspects measured . in summary , using only 37 items , the masi - r can measure the perception of wellness and support , the resilience capability , and the behavioral reactions of individuals coping with stressful situations in the workplace . further , unlike other instruments , the masi - r provides a lie index capable of identifying cheating responders , a phenomenon that can occur in workplace contexts . it is focused on the relation between the worker and stressful situations on the job , and it could be used to drive interventions centered on the interaction between the work environment and individual perceptions and resources .']"

       "['a large variety of products could be suggested for the treatment of iron deficiency in children and since the absorption of fe ( ii ) is more effective than that of other oral iron products , its consumption is more common . it is usually prescribed to prevent iron deficiency in children from 6 months to 2 years of age . its consumption may cause black discoloration on primary tooth , and many parents think that a kind of decay has been formed after giving iron drops to their children ; this may be the reason why they limit the consumption of this essential element by their children . this dental discoloration is one of the reasons parents and children refer to dental offices . demineralization of enamel has a clinical importance and many studies investigated the differences between the susceptibility of the enamel in primary and permanent teeth to erosion . in some studies [ amaechi et al . and hunter et al . ] , more susceptibility to enamel erosion was observed in primary teeth ( 50% more mineral loss and 30% more lesion depth ) . the enamel of primary teeth is less mineralized than that of permanent teeth and the density of its outermost layer is lesser . besides the other factors causing tooth decay , such as poor hygiene and inappropriate diet , erosion and softening of enamel can lead to the emergence of early dental caries in children . as it has been shown in the study of kazoullis et al . in 2007 , dental erosion in primary teeth is almost three times more common than in permanent teeth and it has a high relation to caries experience in children . according to some studies , the oldest study in this regard is by james and parfitt conducted in 1953 , in which they investigated the effects of different iron tonics on healthy teeth ; after a week , they found that tooth decay was related to the acidity of the solution . this paper has recommended that iron tonics should be administered through a straw or glass tube for babies . however , in younger children , parents usually dilute the drugs and use a teaspoon to feed the baby , and the child sucks the medication on his / her upper incisors . if this continues for a long time , decalcification of upper labial incisor enamel surfaces that are often associated with dental caries will appear . if the drug also contains a sweetener , the risk of caries significantly increases . in severe cases , there is a risk of tooth fracture , and it may progress toward gums until only the root remains . but we can not say that dental damage always occurs following the use of iron tonics . the degradation rate depends on the acidity of iron tonic , frequency , duration , method of use , but regular consumption of acidic syrups clearly has the potential to cause destruction of the tooth structure . in some studies , chewable tablets , ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) , and multivitamin syrup also have been found to reduce the hardness of teeth . therefore , we decided to investigate the effects of these pharmaceutical products on the variation in microhardness of the primary teeth . this study which was done to evaluate the effects of two types of iron drops and two multivitamin drops on the hardness of enamel in 40 primary teeth used the iron and multivitamin drops approved by the ministry of health that are available in drugstores .',\n",
       " 'the buccal surfaces of the extracted primary teeth without caries , erosion , cracks , and enamel lesions were identified and randomly divided into four groups . first , some important chemical parameters relevant to erosion , such as titrable acidity ( ta ) , ph , and the amount of fluoride , citric acid , calcium , phosphate , and the citrate content of the drugs , were identified at the medical biochemistry laboratories of tehran university and babol university of medical sciences . drugs ph was measured by a digital ph - meter basic 20 + ( crison instrument , sa , barcelona , spain ) , and maguire method was used to determine ta . the amount of added base to attain ph 7 was measured using a ph electrode , wherein 50 ml of each drug was titrated by naoh . 1 n calcium and phosphate were determined using a standard biochemistry kit employing the spectrophotometric method ( cecil , uk ) at the biochemistry laboratory of babol university of medical sciences . the amount of fluoride was analyzed using ion selective electrode and the amount of citric acid was also analyzed by uv - visible spectrophotometry ( shimadrou ) at the biochemistry laboratory of tehran medical university . the list of examined drops was as follows : \\n kharazmi iron drop , made in iran ( containing 25 mg / ml of iron ions)shahdarou multivitamin drop , made in iraneurovit multivitamin drop , eurhovital , germanyironorm iron drop , wallace , britain , containing 125 mg of ferrous sulfate bp equivalent to 25 mg of iron per ml . \\n  kharazmi iron drop , made in iran ( containing 25 mg / ml of iron ions ) shahdarou multivitamin drop , made in iran eurovit multivitamin drop , eurhovital , germany ironorm iron drop , wallace , britain , containing 125 mg of ferrous sulfate bp equivalent to 25 mg of iron per ml . investigations were done on the labial surface of 40 extracted mandibular primary central and lateral incisors of 40 children aged between 5 and 8 years ; the extraction time was not more than 3 months . teeth were kept in a package containing saline 0.9% at room temperature until the study time . before measuring the hardness , the teeth were embedded in polyester , so that lingual surface of the tooth crown was immersed inside a polyester mold to the extent that only the surface of crown remained out of the polyester . since the surface - intact enamel has higher amount of fluoride and higher resistance against acids than the lower layers , it was tried to polish the samples minimally by silicon carbide papers with the numbers 800 , 1000 , 1200 , 2000 , and 2500 grit under surface water pressure , until almost smooth surfaces free of scratches could be seen under a microscope . then , the initial hardness measurement was performed using vickers microhardness tester machine ( mh1 , koopa pazhoohesh , tehran , iran ) . at first , the labial surface of the teeth was examined and the best straight and parallel surface was determined to apply the force . then , the indentor of hardness tester was placed on the tooth surfaces and after imposing 50 g force for 10 s , the surface was examined again under the microscope . a square point was created on the tooth surface and two diagonals of this square were measured by a liner which is embedded within the device ( d1 , d2 ) to obtain the average of diagonals ( d ) ; vickers hardness number was calculated with d and p ( imposed force ) using the formula : hv = 2p ( sin /2 d2 ) . teeth with hardness in the range of 250500 knoop hardness number ( khn ) equivalents to 239478 hardness vickers ( hv ) were selected because the numbers out of this range are out of the normal range . after measuring the initial hardness , 40 teeth were randomly divided into four groups of 10 teeth each and each group was immersed in the above - mentioned drops for 5 min . during this period , the teeth were placed in a shaker incubator ( unimax 1010 ; heidolph , germany ) at 37c . after removal from the solution , the teeth were washed with distilled water and hardness of each tooth was measured again with a vickers hardness tester machine . it should be noted that to obtain the exact number each time , hardness test was measured on the tooth surface at three points in same surface and the average values were considered as the hardness of samples . in order to compare the hardness of teeth , paired t - test was used before and after exposure to drops and analysis of variance was used to compare the impact of drops on the hardness of teeth ; and in all samples , p < 0.05 was considered significant . at the end , 15 teeth were selected for scanning electron microscopic ( sem ) study : 3 control samples without the influence of drugs , and 12 samples in four groups of 3 samples each , which were previously immersed in drops for 5 min . first , they were vacuumed and then dehydrated ; then , they were covered by a very thin layer of gold ( ball - tec , lausanne , switzerland ) and examined by sem ( philips , xl30 ; almelo , the netherlands ) at tarbiat modarres university . it should be mentioned that this part of study was a qualitative study to assess the changes in tooth surfaces .',\n",

       " \"since one of the erosion assessment methods is to measure the microhardness of enamel , the hardness of enamel in primary teeth was measured by vickers hardness tester machine before and after exposure to test drops used in this study . as primary anterior teeth are the first teeth appear in the mouth and are important in a child 's appearance , parents realize their discoloration soon . in 2000 , lussi et al . examined the enamel microhardness of primary and permanent teeth after consumption of a number of drinks and foods , effervescent tablets , vitamin c , and multivitamin syrup ; they found that all the materials under study , except for fruit yogurt , significantly reduced the hardness of enamel in primary and permanent teeth and the overall rate of reduction was 17.5  27.2 khn for primary teeth . the highest reduction was after 4 min of immersion in sprite beverage ( 151.8 khn hardness reduction in primary teeth ) . in our study , the reduction rate was 167.34  48.55 for kharazmi iron drops , which was higher than the values obtained in the study of lussi et al . there are some studies that examined other medicines with erosion potential , like mcnally et al . , in which six analgesic solutions containing citric acid were studied ; they found that there was only one analgesic solution with the clinical potential for enamel erosion . in 2006 , costa et al . consumption of this drug along with ph cycling reduced the hardness in vitro , simulating the daily dose to 46.83% . furthermore , sales - peres et al . studied the effect of a mouthrinse containing iron on enamel and dentin erosion . they found that there was more erosion in the enamel than in dentin and iron solution could cause significant decrease in enamel surface microhardness change ( smh % ) ; this could be due to the precipitation of ferric phosphate formed by ingredient of phosphate ion that can be soluble on the enamel surface , which acts as a barrier on the enamel and reduces tooth tissue loss . in a study by kato et al . on the effect of iron on demineralization of bovine enamel blocks after the consumption of a beverage containing 10 mmol / l iron , the wear was significantly reduced . it seems that iron solution itself causes significant reduction in enamel surface microhardness changes and the loss of tooth tissue , and in fact , the low ph of drops containing iron can lead to dental erosion . however , in the meantime , ta is more important because the total amount of acid ( ta ) represents the actual amount of available h+ to react with the dental surfaces . acids are usually used as a buffering agent to maintain the chemical stability , for the control of consistency , or for physiological adaptations . acidic ingredients have better taste and improve patient compliance . however , the amount of citrate was significant in kharazmi and shahdarou drops ( 498 and 102 ppm , respectively ) . it seems that parameters like ph , exposure time , temperature , and type of acid could affect the strength of acidic materials to cause erosion . the ph of drops used in this study was in the range of 2.13.3 , which is below the critical ph range of enamel . meanwhile , kharazmi iron drop had the lowest ph and highest ta ( 2.37 ) . as can be seen in the sem photographs , this may cause the demineralization of enamel surfaces . in the sem images of the kharazmi iron drops , enamel erosion and porosity , cracks , and fractures although we do not know exactly what caused the pores and cracks , they may be due to the exposure to low ph or the pharmaceutical combinations or dehydration . the increase of surface roughness , however , can cause more retention of the plaque and increased susceptibility to tooth decay . endogenous erosive potential effects of some common drugs used for children , such as salbutamol ( ph = 6.05 ) , paracetamol ( ph = 6.77 ) , and theophylline ( ph = 7.71 ) , were studied by babu et al . using sem ; in all the samples , irregular erosion cavities were observed in teeth enamel surfaces . all drugs used in their study ( analgesics , antibiotics , anti - epileptics , multivitamins , and anti - tussives ) showed an erosive effect on primary enamel surfaces . the majority of the medications , especially multivitamins , caused etched prism pattern followed by crater formation and sporadic rod ends . the content of calcium , phosphate , and fluoride of drugs has a protective effect . in comparison to kharazmi iron drop , ironorm iron drop caused lower reduction in microhardness of samples due to high levels of calcium and phosphate . among the studied drugs , the eurovit drop was safer than others , and this can be related to the higher ph , higher amount of calcium , and lower citrate than the other drops there was no significant difference in the amount of fluoride in the studied drops and the low levels do not seem to have a protective role . this was an in vitro study , so the role of protective factors such as saliva has not been evaluated . perhaps in the future in vitro studies , this shortcoming can be compensated by performing ph cycling partially . eskandarian et al . studied the effect of three iron drops on the surface hardness of primary tooth in artificial decay plants ; the results have shown that iron supplements have no effect on the demineralization of the teeth structure . the difference between the results of their study and the present study could be due to the different concentrations of iron drops ( 1 ml iron in 25 ml medium ) and the difference in the procedures ; for example , in their study , after immersing in solutions , the samples were polished and then microhardness was measured , which may remove the most superficial layer influenced by the drugs . another characteristic of our study was the least polish on the enamel surfaces because our goal was to maintain the superficial outer layer of enamel with the most similarity with the oral environment . data obtained from this study can be used by physicians and dentists to provide sufficient information about the erosive power of the prescribed medications for consumers . it can be far better to use solid forms such as tablets instead of liquid form . if this is not possible , the patient should be advised to rinse the mouth immediately after taking the medicine . it is not recommended to brush the teeth right away because the enamel softened by acid treatment can be easily removed by toothbrush and toothpaste . the drug should not be taken at bedtime or between the main meals . in the case of older children , sugar - free gum according to other studies , adding xylitol , fluoride , or a combination of them to the acidic drinks or using fluoride with xylitol as a mouthwash after exposure to acidic solutions could not prevent the enamel erosion . since acidic attacks are much stronger in erosion , the absence of mineral materials is much stronger than what happens in the process of tooth decay . this means that the mechanism of anti - demineralization of fluoride and xylitol may not be effective enough against the erosion process . adding casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate ( ccp - acp ) , casein phosphopeptide - amorphous calcium phosphate fluoride ( cpp - acpf ) , and tricalcium phosphate fluoride ( tcp - f ) to beverages without affecting the taste of the drink the protective property of tif4 is related to the resistant surface coating against acids which can increase the presence of fluoride and titanium on enamel hydroxyapatite net . it seems that further studies are required on the protective role of these new materials . it is possible to decrease the potential for erosion in syrups by correcting the type of acid , for example , by using maleic acid instead of citric acid and by adding calcium and phosphate as supplements . according to the result of present study , although three brands of iron products , including kharazmi , shahdarou and ironorm , reduced the average enamel microhardness of primary teeth , there was a definite reduction in microhardness in the group exposed to kharazmi drop , which was significantly different from the other groups .\"]"
