introduction. pulmonary hypertension( ph) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and differs from ph as manifest in adults in several important ways, such as the development of ph in a growing lung. medical treatment of pediatric ph has been challenging due to a lack of accessible, non invasive, objective measures that can aid in managing these patients.introduction. pulmonary arterial hypertension( ph) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. methods. plasma samples were collected from 70 pediatric patients with ph ranging in age from newborn to 21. 3 years old. disease prognosis was determined using he mo dynamic parameters measured in the cardiac catheter iz ation laboratory during a routine pulmonary hypertension visit.introduction. pulmonary hypertension( ph) is the most common cause of death in pediatric patients. we developed a novel method to determine the predictive value of ph biomarkers in patients with ph. methods. we performed a cross- sectional study of 70 pediatric patients with a mean age of 18. 5 years( range, 12 to 24 years) who underwent pulmonary echo car dio graph y. results. of the 70 patients, only 39 had complete data in order to assess the responder status based on the pediatric definition. there were no significant differences between the ipah and apah groups for any of the protein levels.background. pediatric pulmonary hypertension( ph) is a complex disease characterized by a wide range of inflammatory and pro life rat ive factors. the aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of plasma proteins in predicting outcomes in pediatric patients with ph. methods. we analyzed the data of patients with mild or moderate pulmonary hypertension who underwent echo car dio graph y and pulmonary function tests( pf fs). results. the mean age of the patients was 15. 8 years( range, 6- 17 years). the mean pf f was significantly higher in children with mild pulmonary hypertension than in those with moderate pulmonary disease( p< 0. 001). in addition, the mean serum levels of il-6, il-10, and mcp-1 were significantly lower in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension compared to those without severe pulmonary disease. conclusions. the addition of a plasma protein index, weighted mostly by il- 6, and il-1 concentrations, significantly increased the probabilities for those patients with an adverse event compared to hemodynamic measurements alone.
background randomized clinical trials( rct s) have important limitations because random iz ation removes potential bias from unknown and unmeasured con founders, observed differences in measured outcomes can be reasonably attributed to the treatment alone. however, observational studies are valuable because they contribute pragmatic knowledge about treatment risk, effectiveness, and cost in clinical practice settings.introduction randomized controlled trials( rct s) are the gold standard for evaluating clinical outcomes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease( copd). however, there is no universally accepted definition of exacerbation s. we conducted a parallel analysis of copd- related health care utilization and costs in patients receiving initial maintenance therapy( imt) with flu or ode oxy glucose( fsc), total opioid use( tio), or interleukin-6( il-6). methods using propensity score matching, we compared the results of a previous mr analysis of patients with copd receiving imt with fsc, tio, or ipr.background randomized controlled trials( rct s) are commonly used to compare outcomes between patients with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease( copd). however, there is a paucity of data on the effects of coexisting conditions on outcomes. we compared outcomes of patients with copd with those of patients without copd. methods we used propensity score matching( p sm) to assess outcomes of copd in 32,338 patients who met patient selection criteria. we used cox proportional hazards models to assess differences in copd- related outcomes. results after matching, the groups were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics: mean copd and all- cause outpatient visits( p< 0. 001), mean days supply of s aba s( p= 0. 017), and mean total copd utilization( p> 0. 05). after adjusting for age, gender, com or bidi ties, and co morbidity, we found no significant differences between the groups.background the purpose of this study was to compare copd- related health care utilization and costs between two analytic approaches to observational research. methods we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with copd who were matched to patients who were treated with initial maintenance therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease( copd). we used propensity score matching( p sm) to compare the copd outcomes between the two methods. we used cox proportional hazard models to compare differences in copd costs between the groups. results we found that the p sm analysis yielded similar copd rates for copd patients( p< 0. 001) compared to patients matched to those matched to healthy controls( p= 0. 01). we also found that there was no significant difference in the mean copd cost per patient in both methods( p> 0. 05). conclusions we conclude that p sm can be used to estimate copd health care costs in a population- based manner.
